Round 3 saw us do a little better but somehow, in round 4 we managed to snatch most of the points and finished a respectable 3rd earning ourselves £6! Since we're a team of 4 - £6 wasn't much use to us so we kindly donated our winnings to the charity pot.<br /><br />Roll on 2 weeks to the next quiz!<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/general.html">general</a>, <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/pub.html">pub</a></p>

I am nice sometimes ;o)<br /><br />We started with a couple of pre-dinner G&Ts before heading off to the Brasserie for dinner at 8.30pm. Mal have a special offer on at present - 2 courses plus wine and coffee for 2 for £29. We had a limited menu to choose from - the "home grown and local" menu which had a choice of 4 starters and mains. IN the end, we both chose the same thing - pea and Gorgonzola risotto to start followed by coq au vin with a side order of cabbage and bacon. Yum! Of course no dinner is complete without dessert so we chose a bread and butter pudding which was out of this world! <br /><br />After dinner it was back to the bar for a nightcap before heading home to bed.<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/general.html">general</a>, <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/life.html">life</a>, <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/pub.html">pub</a></p>

	 a fruit and veg story...
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>We didn't do too well at the quiz this week. 2nd last!  The runner however was particularly fun this week so I've decided to copy it here to share with you as it was a paper round, not a TV round.<br /><br />All you need to do is fill in the missing blanks to this story.  All the blanks are the name of either a fruit or veg and the number of letters are given in brackets...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">A Fruit and Veg Story</span><br /><br />_____(7) begin by telling you a story about Darren and Angela, greengrocers from Birkenhead and their regular Sunday adventures.  Each Sunday they got up bright and early.  Whilst Angela got dressed, Darren went for his early morning _____(4).  Every morning, the first thing Darren did was go for a _____(3).<br /><br />This week, they decided to go on a boating trip with Angela's Mam, melanie and her new man Arty,  Angie's friend Anna was going to come too.  Anna was a _____(5).  Although she lived in on the Wirral, she was born in Malmo.  Anna decided not to come as she had a blind _____(4) with someone she'd not me before and usually she felt like a _____(10) when she went out with two couples.  They all thought this was a good idea as they didn't want to _____(6) from coming, but the car only had four seats and two _____(4) would fit better.<br /><br />Darren had just got a _____(4) job in Belgium that paid lots of money, but this meant he has to visit _____(8) a lot, but the increase in _____(6) meant they could afford a new car, a little red _____(9),  Unfortunately, as Angela reversed out of their drive, she scratched the car on the garden wall.<br /><br />As they pulled up at Angela's Mam's house, Arty noticed the damage to the car,  "Do you know the car's scratched?" aid Arty.  "Yeah" said Darren, "_____(6) did it.  I'll take it round to my mate, Mike, he's a mechanic".  "By the way, how's the _____(6, 4) Darren?" said Arty , as Darren had been learning a new language to help him in his new job.<br /><br />They all drove down to the river and got in a rowing boat.  The boat was very small and there was not _____(8) and it was a bit of a _____(6).  Arty sat at the front, Darren at the back with the two women in the middle holding the oars, Angela on one side, _____(5) the other.  "I feel a right _____(5) sat at the back" said Darren.  They set off against a strong _____(7).  Arty saw a seal turn it's head in the shallow water near the riverbank.  Darren below a loud _____(9) at it.  "Your behaviour _____(6) me Darren" said Angela's mother.  "_____(7) may" said Darren.  "That Darren is incorrigable flower" said Arty to Angela's mother.  "_____(5) a little Mother" said Angela in defence of her husband.<br /><br />Finally, they reached another berth further down the river.  They disembarked and walked towards the City Centre.  "I'm hungry" said Arty, "I forgot to bring my usual bag of nuts".  They argued about who should go into the shop as there was a big black dog standing next to the door.  "Look at that _____(11)" said Arty to Mel.  It was decided that Darren would go in.  When Darren was in the shop, he realised he didn't have any money, so he asked the shopkeeper if he would accept his card.  "No, but i'll _____(6) a cheque" said the shopkeeper.  Darren bought a big bag of nuts.  Finally he got out of the shop.  "Where have you _____(4)" said Angela to Daren.  Darren handed the nuts around but they made _____(9) as he ate them too quickly.  After Arty had recovered, they all decided the whole day had been a disaster so they all agreed to go home.<br /><br />And that's _____(7)<br /><br />L x<br /><br />PS.

I had a No.12 which was a prawn thing (deep fried prawns with a ginger and something flavour) which I shared with Dan along with the "Mo Mo" he had (lamb dumplings), both of which were very nice.

I say "lunch" because we met at 1.15pm and although we did actually eat lunch, we didn't actually leave the pub until around 8.30pm!<br /><br />We did try to leave before then. We even got out of our seats and went to the bar to settle the bill and ended up coming back with cocktails instead! :<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">oP</span><br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/friends.html">friends</a>, <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/general.html">general</a>, <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/pub.html">pub</a></p>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>We won the quiz last night!  :oD<br /><br />The evening started with the usual "you can only have 4 per team" and the usual reply "we always have 6" with a "we never win anyway".  Oops!<br /><br />Well, we did win this week, a whole £6.00 which we kindly donated to charity (we're not here to win, it's the taking part that counts!)<br /><br />Not sure how we did manage to win.  Once again, we were doing pretty badly on the actual quiz and made it all up on the "runner" round which this week was films.<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/friends.html">friends</a>, <a rel='tag' href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/labels/pub.html">pub</a></p>
