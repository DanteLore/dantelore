      <div style="clear:both;"></div>We started the weekend with a night of drinking and dancing.<br /><br />We met in O'Neills and ended up staying there for the night. It was quite cheap. Just before 10.30pm we decided we should move on and thought we could get into Reflex for free No such luck, they charged us £5 to get in and no amount of moaning did us any good.<br /><br />I've always wanted to go to Reflex as it's the 80's bar (seems they changed the Flares 70's bars into Reflex 80's bars.<br /><br />Reflex was good, playing lots of songs you could sing and dance around to though I was bit upset that they played lots of 70's and 90's music!<br /><br />Just as they called last orders at 1.50am we decided to head home, via the kebab shop!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>No dancing tonight as it's half-term.<br /><br />That means there's only 5 more lessons before my medal test!  I haven't done a medal test since I was about 14 so it seems a bit scary.  Apparently, It's not as strict as kids medals.  You go in in groups of 4 though you are still marked individually.  We've got 3 dances to learn, I'm fine with 2 of them, it's the actual dance one I' m unsure of.<br /><br />So, with no dancing tonight and not much food in the cupboards now there's only 2 days before pay day what more was there to do than get a takeaway curry!  Yum!  :o)<br /><br />This week looks busy.  So far, we're out Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday night!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>This weekend has been very lazy!<br /><br />Saturday we spent most of the day in front of the computer or the TV.  We did venture into town around 5.00pm for a wander.  Dan got a new <a href="https://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,,57064,00.html">phone</a> and I got a new pair of jeans.<br /><br />After town, we went back to the computer and the TV for a while before dinner which we ate in front of the TV!  After CSI, it was back to playing The Sims and then it was time for bed.<br /><br />Today has been pretty much the same as Saturday although we haven't ventured out of the house at all.  We were supposed to be off to the pub quiz tonight but have decided against it due to lack of funds all round!<br /><br />Dinner is now cooking and I guess after that it'll be back to the TV and computer before bed and work tomorrow!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 busy week...
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>This week has proved to be somewhat on the busy side.<br /><br />On Wednesday Dan went for a walk with his Dad and Stepmam, Jos to the Chilterns.  In the evening, they came back to Reading and took us our for dinner.  After a big conflab about where to eat (the walkers had eaten a rather big lunch and weren't feeling too hungry) we decided on Tapas so headed off to one of my favourite restaurants, <a href="https://www.latasca.co.uk/index.cfm/fuseaction/home/cat/HOME/1.cfm">La Tasca</a>.<br /><br />When the <a href="https://www.latasca.co.uk/index.cfm/fuseaction/home/cat/TAPAS/1.cfm">food</a> finally arrived, the table was packed, with every spare inch filled with delicious food.  We had;<br /><ul><li>chicken in white wine & garlic sauce</li><li>caserole of lamb in white wine, potatoes, mustard & peppercorns</li><li>fried potatoes sauteed with onions red & green peppers</li><li>chorizo sausage pan fried in red wine</li><li>grilled pork loin marinated with paprika &amp; garlic, served on toasted bread</li><li>toasted bread topped with smoked salmon & cream cheese served with fresh lemon</li><li>meatballs served with vegetable and tomato sauce</li><li>a selection of cured Spanish meats</li><li>squid coated in batter, deep fried &amp; served with garlic mayonnaise</li><li>and some bread and olives</li></ul>All of it was very yummy!  After dinner, we said goodbye and headed back home, via the <a href="https://www.readingpubs.co.uk/pubs/showpub.asp?pub=Hook+and+Tackle&postcode=RG1+2ND">local</a> for a quick nightcap.<br /><br />On Thursday night, we invited <a href="https://www.skenepages.com">Skene</a> over for a few drinks and some dinner before he heads off on his "holiday".  <a href="https://www.askjohnson.net">Johnson</a> and Georgie came too.  After scoffing a deliciuous dinner of lasagne, washed down with 3 bottles of wine, we headed off to the <a href="https://www.readingpubs.co.uk/pubs/showpub.asp?pub=Hook+and+Tackle&postcode=RG1+2ND">local</a>.  3 house double gin & tonics later we returned home for more drinking and chatting.  At 1.30am I gave up and went to bed, leaving Dan & Skene to carry on. <br /><br />Friday morning came far too soon.  Not a good idea to start work at 8.00am!<br /><br />We had no plans for Friday night this week and boy was I glad!  Greasey food was calling us so we naughtily went to the <a href="https://www.thefoodplace.co.uk/details/21647/">Istanbul Grill</a> for kebab and chips!  The rest of the evening was spent either in front of the TV or the computer.  At 11.30pm I completely gave up and went to bed where I was asleep within seconds...<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I am addicted to this website - <a href="https://www.readingpubs.co.uk/index.asp">Reading Pubs</a>.<br /><br />Two lads are on a mission to drink at least a pint in every pub within a two mile radius of Reading town centre.<br /><br />They also provide good reviews of each pub including what kind of beer they serve.<br /><br />Their mission to drink in all the pubs by 31st December 2004 doesn't look like it'll happen though.<br /><br />Nice one lads, it's interesting stuff.

	 pub quiz...
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Last night we went to the pub quiz at <a href="https://www.readingpubs.co.uk/pubs/showpub.asp?pub=Hook+and+Tackle&postcode=RG1+2ND">The Hook and Tackle</a> with George and Richard.<br /><br />It was a pub quiz with a difference, kind of like a cross between a pub quiz and bingo. Everyone gets a score card which have different numbered questions on and if you have that numbered question, you can answer it. There's 2 lots of prizes up for grabs, the first to get the "Top 2 Bottom 2" and a "Block of 6". We did manage to have a go at trying to win a couple of times but our answers were never fully correct!<br /><br />The last game also had the "Jackpot" round. If you got the top, middle and bottom question within the first 5 questions asked you could win £200.<br /><br />Luck was on me last night and the 5th question asked gave me my 3rd jackpot question. The questions I had to answer were;<br /><br />1. What was the name of Captain Pugwash's ship?<br />2. What is the minimum age a US President can be?<br />3. Which MP was killed by a car bomb in 1990?<br /><br />Unfortunately, I wasn't that lucky and only managed to answer 1 of the questions correctly.<br /><br />It was a fun night and I think we may be off to try again next Sunday.<br /><br />L x<br /><br />PS. In case you were wondering, the correct answers are - The Black Pig, 35 and Ian Gow.<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Went into town last night for some drinkies with Dan, Debbie, Jason, Stacey, George and Richard.<br /><br />We met up in <a href="https://www.readingpubs.co.uk/pubs/showpub.asp?pub=Great+Expectations&amp;postcode=RG1+4PS+">Great Expectations</a> which was busier than I've ever seen it before. Had a couple of games of pool with some random Irish bloke who seemed to want to sell something to anyone who'd listen but didn't actually tell you what it was he wanted to sell you!<br /><br />I managed to have a never ending pint. 2 hours later, it was still full. They had a promotion on Strongbow giving £1.00 of a pint so I decided to take up the offer. They also kept coming round with free samples so it kept me topped up with cider all night! :o)<br /><br />When they finally chucked us out the pub about 11.30pm we decided to call it a night and headed home with George and Richard while the rest went on to <a href="https://www.ponana.com/venues/ponana/reading/index.html">Po Na Na's</a>.<br /><br />Dan and Richard played on the decks, spinning tunes and then we ordered pizza from Pizza Presto which were very yummy! I especially liked the Mighty Meat. And then I fell asleep!<br /><br />Was a really good night out!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Had a night on the <a href="https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/tic.nsf/cquartpub/NT0001784E?opendocument">Quayside</a> last night, first time in ages!<br /><br />Met up with Lisa who I've not seen for a very long time, too long!  Had a really good night. <br /><br />You do forget how busy it gets though.  And it's becoming hen night central.  There was millions of hen night people.  Two crowds had at least 20 people in them each!<br /><br />Me and Dan wussed out of clubbing but Lisa and Gillian somehow managed to get free VIP passes into Sea the lucky buggers so they went off there while we had a very nice naughty burger and chips before heading home.<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Went to see <a href="https://www.cellularthemovie.com/">Cellular</a> last night.<br /><br />It's a really good thriller movie. Had me on the edge of my seat quite a few times as I couldn't quite work out what was gonna happen.<br /><br />The storyline seemed like it might've been a little bit far fetched but I certainly enjoyed it!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
