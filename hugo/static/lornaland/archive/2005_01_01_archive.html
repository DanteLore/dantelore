      <div style="clear:both;"></div>We went to see <a href="http://www.chittythemusical.co.uk/frame.htm">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a> at the London Palladium yesterday.  The tickets were a Christmas present from my Mam and Dad and Dan was the lucky one who had to accompany me.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/palladium.jpg" alt="palladium.jpg" /><br /><br />We arrived in London around 1.30pm and headed straight to the theatre for a pre-theatre drink (although it was just a coke!)  The show was fantastic, though I may be biased as the main purpose of my visit was see the star of the show - Jason Donovan!  :o)<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/chitty.jpg" alt="chitty.jpg" /><br /><br />After the show it was raining (something which the bbc didn't forecast for!) so a wander around was out of the question.  In search of a pub, we decided to head over to Greenwich.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/danchitty.jpg" alt="danchitty.jpg" /><br /><br />After a few glasses of wine, we popped across the road to the noodle bar before heading back to Paddington for the train home. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/noodles.jpg" alt="noodles.jpg" /><br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>We had aother poker night on Friday.<br /><br />I was playing quite well on and seemed to get on a bit of a winning streak, I won the 2nd game  :o)<br />I was also doing quite well in the money round (players pay £1.00, winner takes all) but lost in the end.  Nevermind.<br /><br />I enjoy the poker nights which are now becoming a regular monthly thing. We've become members of the local casino though I'll probably become too scared when actual money is involved ad the players are pretty good. And they don't play Texas Hold'Em there either. Should be a laugh though.<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I did something naughty today, I rang in sick!<br /><br />I woke up this morning and felt as rough as ever.  The headache I've had since Monday afternoon is still with me, my nose is red and crusty from blowing my nose constantly and my cough is getting a bit worse.<br /><br />So, I decided to have a day in bed to try and shift this thing once and for all.  I woke up at 12.00pm and had my first lemsip of the day.  I think the good sleep has done me some good but I still feel bad.<br /><br />I hate colds!  :o(<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Poor me!<br /><br />What's worse is I think I may have shared my germs with Dan. He's feeling poorly too now. A night of relaxing in front of the TV under the duvet is required.<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Happy 2005!  :o)<br /><br />As you can tell, I've been a bit lazy with my blog recently. There are a number of factors which have contributed to my laziness;<br /><ol>   <li>Christmas shopping<br /></li>   <li>Drinking</li>   <li>Christmas</li>   <li>Traveling</li>   <li>Playing the Sims<br /></li> </ol> So, here's a quick round-up...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">11th December</span> - Christmas Cocktail Party<br />We invited a few friends round for an evening of cocktail making. Richard became master cocktail maker though not quite Tom Cruise standard with the old tricks and by the end of the night had given up on the list and make his own concoctions.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/dec1.jpg" alt="dec1.jpg" /><br />The hosts<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/dec2.jpg" alt="dec2.jpg" /><br />Richard and one of his creations<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/dec3.jpg" alt="dec3.jpg" /><br />Jason has a go<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">16th December</span> - Christmas Night Out at <a href="http://www.squarebarandgrill.co.uk/">The Square Bar and Grill</a> in Newbury.<br />As with all Christmas meals we chose our food weeks in advance, much to the annoyance of Dan. We both decided on Wood Pigeon as a starter and both wished we hadn't. For me, it was too rare. I like my meat to be nice and hot with not so much as a hint of blood. Dan decided it tasted too much like offal which he doesn't like at all. For the main meal, I opted for the traditional Turkey dinner while Dan decided to splash out the extra money and had the steak. No complaints there and certainly none for the dessert or I should say in Dan's case, desserts! A cheeky comment to me in front of what seemed to be the main man meant Dan got both desserts. No, he's not greedy! ;o) After dinner, we popped into <a href="http://www.slugandlettuce.co.uk/">The Slug and Lettuce</a> for a quick beverage before heading home.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">18th December</span> - Afternoon Drinking.<br />We met up with George and Richard a spot of afternoon drinking in the very classy <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/show.shtml/368/Pavlovs_Dog/Reading">Pavlov's Dog</a>.  Well, it was quite cheap!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">21st December</span> - After work we headed up to Newcastle for the first part of our Christmas trip.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">23rd December</span> - Christmas Eve at the <a href="http://www.pub-explorer.com/tandw/pub/lakesidegateshead.htm">Lakeside Inn</a>.<br />Christmas Eve wouldn't be the same without the obligatory trip to the Lakey to meet up with old School friends. This year it was somewhat full of mostly my year.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">25th December</span> - Christmas Day!<br />Yeah, the big day arrived! We woke at 8.00am to find Santa had already been and brought lots and lots of presents! I got some new <a href="http://www.salonlines.co.uk/forwomen/index.php?p=1&category_id=445&amp;product_id=1291">straightners</a>, PJ's, DVD's make-up and other girlie things and Dan got a <a href="http://www.kelkoo.co.uk/ctl/go/shopbotGo?catId=134401&JServSessionIduk=n1kmglmu63.WOL2uk&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;merchantId=100410913&pkey=1&amp;orw=true">bin</a>! (it's what he wanted)<br />After our Christmas dinner, we headed off to Nottingham to see Dan's Mam, Stepdad and Gran and continue on the next leg of our Christmas trip.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/251.jpeg" alt="251.jpeg" /><br />Santa's been<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/252.jpeg" alt="252.jpeg" /><br />Lots of presents<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">26th December</span> - Boxing Day<br />We met up with Dan's Dad, Stepmam, Gran and brother for some Boxing Day dinner at <a href="http://www.nottspubs.co.uk/pubs/uptonpubs.html">The French Horn</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">27th December</span> - Nottingham.<br />We headed into Nottingham today to have a mooch round the shops and for me to spend some of my Christmas vouchers on the "Dessert Boots" I wanted.<br />In the evening we headed back into Nottingham to catch up with Dan's friends.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/27th.jpg" alt="27th.jpg" /><br />Matt, Paul and Sally<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/27th2.jpg" alt="27th2.jpg" /><br />Dan does an Elvis impression<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">28th December</span> - Time to go home.<br />After a week of relative visiting it was time to head back to Reading to the sanctuary of our own home.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">30th December</span> - Afternoon Drinking.<br />We met up with Debbie, Jason and Stacey in O'Neills for a few beverages and a gossip and to plan our New Years Eve Night Out. After a few phonecalls and much debating we eventually agreed.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/30.jpg" alt="30.jpg" /><br />Debbie, Jason and Dan<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/302.jpg" alt="302.jpg" /><br />Me and Dan<br /><br /><img src="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/303.jpg" alt="303.jpg" /><br />Dan and his love<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">31st December</span> - New Year's Eve.<br />Debbie and Jason arrived at our house for some Mulled Wine before we headed off to our planned venue for the evening - Great Expectations. When I had called them they day before, I was informed that the pub would be open til 2.00am and there was to be a DJ on. Best of all, there was no admission cost.<br />We arrived pretty early (8.00pm) and the place was quite empty. By 9.30pm it had filled up a fair bit and the DJ was just starting up but we had already decided to find somewhere else (namely <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/show.shtml/4036/ONeills/Reading">O'Neills</a>)<br />Not much change in there though, it was also pretty dead (was it really NYE or had we got the day wrong?)<br />By 11.30pm it was almost empty but we didn't know the secret everyone else did and bought our Champagne and waited for 12.00pm.<br />With a disastrous amount of people left in the pub, they decided to shut early so we were kicked out and decided to head home. However, we got sidetracked and ended up having another drink in <a href="http://www.pub-explorer.com/olpg/brewerytap/reading/">The Brewery Tap</a> before walking back to Debbie and Jason's where I decided to borrow Jason enormous trainers for my journey home.<br />At about 3.30am (and very drunk) I was finally in bed.<br /><br />L x<br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
