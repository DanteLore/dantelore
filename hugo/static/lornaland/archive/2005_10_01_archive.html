      <div style="clear:both;"></div>We went out for dinner last night, my treat!<br /><br />We started the night off in my favorite bar - <a href="https://www.readingpubs.co.uk/pubs/showpub.asp?pub=Sahara+Bar&postcode=RG1+2JR">Sahara Bar</a>. One round, 2 cocktails was £11.50 so we only had the one but they were very nice. We were intending to go to Il Gusto, an Italian restaurant but the cravings for Chinese food overcame us and we headed off to the <a href="https://www.shanpan.com/main.htm">Shanpan</a>.<br /><br />Normally, we find the restaurant empty (though I don't why, it's the best Chinese in Reading) but tonight we were told they were fully booked, Chinese Elvis was appearing later and they'd sold out!) So instead, we headed upstairs to <a href="https://www.readingrestaurants.com/pranakhon/">Pranakhon</a>, the Thai restaurant.<br /><br />We ordered our usual - the £16.50 per person special menu and again we weren't disappointed.<br /><br />After dinner, we headed back to the Sahara Bar for a quick cocktail before heading off to the Slug and Lettuce for a few more drinks before bed.<br /><br />Of course this now means I've spent all my money for the month but hey, it was a good night  ;o)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 bizarre police behavior...
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>We wandered into town on Saturday for a mooch about and noticed there was quite a lot of police about. Reading were obviously at home.<br /><br />On our way home, we saw 2 police on horses with about 8 other policemen on foot walking a small group of lads along. Then the bizarre behavior happened.<br /><br />When they got to the end of the main road, they turned and walked them along by the canal. Hmm, they're going to our house we thought. Then, instead of turning off, they started to walk into the underpass (nearer to our house) Surely the 2 on horses won't go under there we thought, oh yes they did! Once through the tunnel, they then ushered them inside the pub! Our local pub!<br /><br />We'd decided they were obviously some boisterous away fans that the police were helping on their way to the stadium. But why would you usher them into a pub out of town?<br /><br />Very strange behavior!<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>We went to the pub again last night to help cure the Monday Blues.<br /><br />We've given up on our local, <a href="https://www.readingpubs.co.uk/pubs/showpub.asp?pub=Hook+and+Tackle&amp;postcode=RG1+2ND">The Hook and Tackle</a> since new managers took over and have transformed a quiet, fun local pub into a wannabe town centre pub. They've added huge TV's in every corner, play the loudest music ever and offer shooter and cocktails. What ever happened to a nice local pub with nice beer and a cosy, friendly atmosphere?<br /><br />So tonight we ventured off to our new local, the <a href="https://www.readingpubs.co.uk/pubs/showpub.asp?pub=Hop+Leaf">Hop Leaf</a>. It's further to walk but is just what a local should be. They good variety of real ales to keep Mr T happy (they are owned by the Hop Back Brewery) and to keep me happy, they have 2 good ciders on draft :o)<br /><br />We couldn't persuade anyone to leave the house on a Monday night this time so we went on our own.<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>It's been a very long time since the House of Henry hosted a poker night but after the fun we had in Vegas, I couldn't wait to play again. And that's what we did on Friday night.<br /><br />There was just the 6 of us - Me, Dan, Jason, Debbie, Ron & Becca. We ordered in some pizza (or should I say a lot) and had a few beers and played some <a href="https://www.learn-texas-holdem.com/">poker</a>.<br /><br />We played a few hands for money, the first one was 50p each WTO and the second went up to a massive £1 each WTO! I won one game and Jason won the other, unfortunately, I won the 50p game ;oP<br /><br />So, when's the next one?<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 dave and shou's wedding...
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Our first weekend back in England and we're already away for the weekend.<br /><br />We were invited to Dave & Shou's wedding this weekend at the <a href="https://www.bedfordswanhotel.co.uk/">Bedford Swan Hotel</a> in Bedford. Due to numbers at the registery office, we were meeting the happy couple at the hotel for their arrival at 3.00pm.<br /><br />We arrived at the hotel at 2.00pm and checked in. The hotel was right on the river and we were lucky to have a view of it form our room. The hotel was very nice, with lots of exposed old bricks.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/ds1.jpg" alt="ds1.jpg" /><br />The Bride &amp; Groom<br /><br /><img src="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/ds2.jpg" alt="ds2.jpg" /><br />Guests - Frankie, Georgie, Johnson, Gareth & Dan<br /><br />Dinner was served about 4.30pm and was very tasty. For starter we had smoked salmon &amp; smoked haddock (which due to my "fish allergy" Dan enjoyed double helpings of) followed by rack of lamb on a bed of creamed leeks with roast potatoes, cheesey potatoes, sugar snap peas, cauliflower and peppers which I particularity liked due to the fact that for once in my life I could actually eat everything on my plate! For dessert we had a merignue nest filled with strawberries.<br /><br />After the meal the room was transformed into a dance floor and we spent the night boogying away although it took the good old Hokey Kokey to get everyone on the dance floor.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/ds3.jpg" alt="ds3.jpg" /><br />The first dance<br /><br /><img src="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/ds4.jpg" alt="ds4.jpg" /><br />Me and Dan take to the floor<br /><br /><img src="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/ds5.jpg" alt="ds5.jpg" /><br />Me and Dan<br /><br />After nightcaps of whiskey and brandy in the hotel bar, we staggered up to bed at 2.00am.<br /><br />Being pikeys and not wanting to pay the £12pp they charged for breakfast, we said goodbye to the happy couple before wandering off the greasy spoon round the corner for breakfast.<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
