      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I have completed my mighty journey from Reading to Newcastle safely! Hurrah!<br /><br />I woke this morning at 5.00am. Not easy, especially with it being still dark and after only 5 1/2 hours but I just wasn't tired last night though (for a change!). I did get woken at 2.30am by my phone receiving a text message from my beloved telling me he was home safely after his <a href="http://www.logicalgenetics.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=839">night on the town</a> with Ron although I thought it was my alarm and ignored it for ages! :o)<br /><br />I left the house at 6.20am and headed to the station through a deserted Reading town centre. Quite spooky.<br /><br />Luckily, the train was on time, and so was I. I managed to pop into <a href="http://www.whsmith.co.uk/whs/go.asp?menu=Welcome">WHSmith</a> to stock up on magazines and pop, sit and eat a Traditional Cornish pasty from the <a href="http://www.westcornwallpasty.co.uk/flash.html">West Cornwall Pasty Country Company</a> (no sausages rolls ready at that time of the morning) and get a take out tea from the AMT stall (which by the way if you are reading this, I asked for teabag OUT) and be on platform 4 with moments to spare to see my <a href="http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/default.aspx">Virgin Train</a> pull in.<br /><br />Once on board, I settled into my nice reserved seat (what more could you ask for for Â£14) and was pleased to find that no-one sat next to me. That was going to change at Oxford though but luckily, the old Scottish woman was determined to tell the man in the seat behind me that it was her seat. No harm done as neither seat was reserved. Although I didn't get away scott free, someone did sit next to me from Lemington Spa until Birmingham New Street :oP<br /><br />My only complaint, well 2 complaints, were;<br /><ol><li>Having to show my ticket to get it stamped on 3 occasions!</li><li>Virgin trains not having heating! I was sat in a unpleasant draft for the whole journey.</li></ol><p>And so, 20 minutes late, I arrived in Newcastle Central Station after a mere 6 hour journey. I don't need to tell you I had a very numb bum! ;o)</p><p>L x</p><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>For 3 whole days!  :o)<br /><br />I could get used to a 2 day week.  Wonder if they'll make it law?<br /><br />Not looking forward to my early morning tomorrow. My train leaves Reading station at 7.00am so I need to leave the house about 6.15am to make sure I'm there in plenty of time and to get myself stocked up on magazines and food and maybe a nice cup of tea. So that means I need to set my alarm for about 5.00am! Oh my God!<br /><br />Luckily I don't have any heavy bags to carry. I sent my clothes up with Dan in the car on Sunday but I keep worrying about what I've packed so I'll probably end up packing a load more stuff.<br /><br />I'm off to dancing soon.  I've been trying to remember the routines we started last week for our medals but can only remember half of one of them.  Hopefully I'll remember it when we start dancing.<br /><br />And then I need to come home and sort my stuff out, makeup, toiletries and then I think I'll settle down in front of the TV for a bit with a nice glass of wine, or 2!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Last night we went out for some drinks and food to celebrate Dan and Lorna Day.<br /><br />We started the night off with a couple of cocktails in the Sahara Bar.  It's a very nice snazzy looking bar although a wee bit pricey.  But my "Wibble" cocktail was fantastic! <br /><br />After drinks we headed off to <a href="http://www.readingrestaurants.com/the_grand_imperial/">China Palace</a> for our meal.  I was a bit disapointed that they didn't have our favorite duck dish on the menu, nor the mixed starter but we soon found plenty that we liked.<br /><br />For starters we had Aromatic Crispy Duck and Chicken Satay followed by Pork in Plum Sauce and Sizzling Lamb with Ginger and Spring Onion with Egg Fried Rice.  All very yummy and washed down with a very pleasant bottle of house red wine.<br /><br />After dinner, there was time for a quick drink or 2 before home so we wandered off to the Slug an Lettuce, being our favourite pub in the Oracle.  Although I was very sad to find it was closed! The sign in the window promised the "new look" Slug and Lettuce will be open shortly.<br /><br />So, we headed for home and stopped off for a quick one at the <a href="http://www.bestpubs.co.uk/layout0.asp?pub=103741">Hook &amp; Tackle</a> instead.<br /><br />It was a very nice night.<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Oh dear. I think I'm experiencing my first hangover!<br /><br />Well, what was supposed to be a quiet weekend in due to lack of funds has saw us off to the flicks and drinking in the afternoon!<br /><br />Yesterday we went to Newbury for a few beverages and some Chinese food. However, starting drinking at 3.00pm is not a good thing! My downfall was the wine. I started drinking it thinking it would help me pace myself as I would drink it slowly but it just got me very drunk very fast! :oP<br /><br />And my drunkenness caused us to be stopped by the police! How embarrassing. It was nice to know that the police were there to check on me, a young girl being escorted down a street by 2 men aroused suspicions but they let us go when I confirmed I did actually know Dan and Johnson (could've got them a night in the cells if I'd said the wrong thing!) I did apparently make the policeman smile when confessing "I don't like wasting police time!" :o)<br /><br />And now I'm home with a very bad head! The phrase "I'm never drinking again" springs to mind but I know that's not true! :o)<br /><br />L x<br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>It was just under 2 weeks ago that I posted saying it was a <a href="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/2004/09/sunny-september.html">sunny September</a>. Hmm, can't really say that now.<br /><br />The weekend started off quite nice. Saturday was nice and sunny and quite hot but by Saturday night the rain had came (a fact I didn't know until actually leaving the house and realising both my umbrella's had been left at work!) I was just comenting about how chuffed I was with my hair which for some reason looked really cool without me even trying (sod's law! if I'd try to make it nice it would've went wrong and if I try to recreate it, it won't work!)<br /><br />Though having said that, a look at the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/5day.shtml?id=3190">5 day forecast</a> shows big yellow suns until Saturday. Yep, rain for the weekend. How does it know?!<br /><br />This post reminds me of some others on my blog. I'm not obsessed by the weather forecast am I?<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Unfortunately, it's still a popular film and when we got into the <a href="http://www.myvue.com/cinemas/index.asp?SessionID=522C4A96817C46C7861F0B2473047762&amp;ci=38">cinema</a> there was a big queue. By the time we'd bought our supplies the cinema was full and we were forced to sit in the 2nd row.<br /><br />The seats weren't too bad in the end, you kind of get used to the looking up at the screen and everything being magnified. The film itself was very good, I enjoyed it lots. There's lots to make you smile and it's very funny at times.<br /><br />After it ended, we had a nightcap in <a href="http://www.slugandlettuce.co.uk/home.htm">the Slug and Lettuce</a> followed by one for the road before they kicked us out the pub at 12.30am.<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>To get from Reading to Newcastle by train?<br /><br />You won't believe me when I tell you it actually costs less than it does to get from Reading to Paddington!<br /><br />I was expecting it to be quite expensive being the wrong age to receive any discounts (too old for a young persons railcard and too young for a seniors railcard) However, I have just purchased a train ticket to take me from Reading back to my lovely hometown of Newcastle for the measly sum of... <strong>Â£14.00</strong>! Fantastic! Yes, those low cost fares they always tempt you with but which you've never actually seen or know anyone who has managed to get one. Well, now I know they exist!<br /><br />Admittedly it means I will be sat on a <a href="http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/default.aspx">Virgin Cross Country</a> train for most of the day (5 hours and 32 minutes to be precise) and departing Reading at an ungodly hour (07:05) but for that much money, I shouldn't really complain.<br /><br />I was going to <a href="http://www.easyjet.com/en/book/index.asp">fly</a> up as I thought that was quite a cheap option but that would have cost me Â£44.99. Still not bad but Â£30.99 buys you a lot of beer up north! ;o)<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>It was back to dancing tonight after the summer holidays. Not sure whether it was the warm weather or I worked particularly hard but I was very hot and sweaty by the end of it! :o)<br /><br />After dancing we sneaked off to the local for a drink and a chat. 3 house double Gin's later and I crawled into bed and needless to say, slept soundly 'til morning.<br /><br />Quite a fun night!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>There were no mornings in our weekend. Fantastic!<br /><br />Sunday we woke at 12.00pm although we didn't actually get to bed until after 2.00am after a night of eating and drinking.<br /><br />Johnson, James and Andrew were heading into Reading for the night and invited us along. After a few drinks in the garden, we wandered into town for a curry at <a href="http://www.readingrestaurants.com/the_raj_by_the_oracle/">The Raj</a>. The service was a bit slow but the curry was good, the poppadoms were especially nice ;o)<br /><br />After food it was time for more drinking in what seems to be Johnson's favorite pub, <a href="http://www.purpleturtlebar.com/newsite/index.php">The Purple Turtle</a>. Not normally my favorite place but I don't mind it when it's warm and you can stand out the back in the beer garden. I hate to admit it but it's actually not as bad as I first thought. It no longer sends shivers down my spine at the thought of going there :oP<br /><br />We headed for home and more drinking took place before the boys (except Dan) headed home and we went to bed.<br /><br />On Sunday afternoon we participated in Sunday afternoon activities - food shopping, washing the car and sun-bathing! Took advantage of the nice weather. Hopefully, next weekend will be just as nice.<br /><br />So, what looked to be a bit of a boring weekend stuck in the house turned out to be a really fun weekend.<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Blimey, it's September already! How fast is this year going?<br /><br />You wouldn't think it was September. Today is very hot and very sunny! 25 C according to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/5day.shtml?id=3190">weather forecast</a> :o)  And you can smell the BBQ's!<br /><br />The fact that it's the weekend is cool, it's normally hot during the week when you're stuck at work and rainy at the weekend but it seems it'll be hotter tomorrow and forecast for 5 days of sun! British weather is strange.<br /><br />The sunny weather is making me excited about our night out tonight. I like going out when the weather is nice. Makes it more fun!<br /><br />Just gotta decide what I'm gonna wear...<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
