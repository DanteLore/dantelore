	 bank holiday weekend...
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The last bank holiday of 2004.<br /><br />With an invite to Paul and Sarah's wedding in Derby on Sunday 29th we were going to be spending the bank holiday weekend away from home. However, having not had a weekend at home since around mid July, Dan wanted to slob about at home and only venture up North on the day of the wedding. How could I not agree!<br /><br />After our <a href="http://www.lornaland.co.uk/blog/2004/08/reading-fezstival.html">Friday night</a> drinking sesh, Saturday was quite a subdued affair. We ventured no further than town and spent the evening in front of the telly after a slap up beef dinner, yum!<br /><br />The plans for Sunday were thrown out the window when Skene reached Paddington and realised there were no trains to Reading. He could however manage to get a train to Derby so we arranged to meet him there and went off for lunch without him.<br /><br />Around 2.5 hours in the car from Reading and we find ourselves at Derby train station. Our only problem now is getting out of the city. And we thought Reading was bad! We eventually arrive at our home for the night at the <a href="http://www.travelodge.co.uk/travelodge/location.php?hotel_id=123">Derby City Centre Travelodge</a> and after a quick change (well, for me anyway) we find ourselves in the pub next door for a "quick one" before heading to the <a href="http://www.morleyhayes.com/">wedding</a>.<br /><br />Much drinking takes place over the next few hours before it's time to head home to bed.<br /><br />And now the bank holiday weekend is over. All I want is my bed!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Well, I survived my night at the Reading Fezstival!<br /><br />The night started out with us meeting at the Sahara Bar, somewhere we've walked past many times and thought we should try. The decor and ambiance was cool, the prices however weren't so great. Two cocktails = £11.00! Oh well!<br /><br />At 9pm, the queue outside the window for The Fez was beginning to appear so we took our place. Comedy was provided for us by a mad looney man who tried to sing in between telling everyone he was due to be on stage at the festival and almost killing himself by staggering into the road in front of the cars (including a police car!)<br /><br />After a few drinks downstairs, we ventured up to the main room to check out the bands. One of the bands appearing apparently was fronted by the sacked lead singer of some band who were on at the festival. Lots of the crowd had obviously come to see him but seemed to prefer him singing his old bands hits rather than his new stuff.<br /><br />It was a bit disappointing. Not too many bands on and where was Vernon Kay?  Wasn't too terrible though and we roundeded off the evening with a trip to the kebab shop!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Went on our first "proper" night out for ages last Friday. It was fun! We had lots to drink and did a bit of dancing. Makes me realise we should do it more often!<br /><br />Staying round the Oracle Riverside we had drinks in Old Orleans, Bar 38, Bar Med and dare I admit it, Brannigans! My only excuse was that the last pub was the choice of the birthday girl! ;o)<br /><br />So, it's Friday night again and, we're off out again!<br /><br />This time we're off to The Fez Club for what they have imaginativley called, "The Reading Feztival"! There will be lots of bands on, all of which I have never heard of in my life, and it's all being compared by Vernon Kay! Woooo!<br /><br />Should be a fun night though. If nothing else, there's always the bar to prop up! :oP<br /><br />L x<br /><br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>This weekend I spent 4 days camping in Devon.<br /><br />Dan and his fellow chums were away for the week walking the <a href="http://www.swcp.org.uk/">South West Coast Path</a> from <a href="http://www.minehead.net/">Minehead</a> to <a href="http://www.bude.co.uk/Index.htm">Bude</a> and I decided to take some time off and head down there for a few days for a little break, and to provide some moral support.<br /><br />I must point out that I'm not really a camping person. I normally prefer my nice hotel rooms with en-suite bathrooms and full length mirrors but occasionally I don't mind "roughing it" and I have to say that I did actually enjoy myself.<br /><br />It was my second camping trip and I'm sure it won't be my last (mainly due to the cheapness) although we do need to invest in a bigger tent.<br /><br />We also need to find ourselves a decent airbed. I bought a brand new one to take with me as the one Dan kept going down during the night and this one did exactly the same thing! Luckily I have my receipt so can take it back. But I mean for £12.00, I'd have expected a lot better! ;o)<br /><br />Anyway <a href="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/longwalk/index.html">the walk</a> went very well. They completed a total of 126.5 miles, not including the extra miles walked up and down hills! There were lots of blisters, aches and pains but everyone managed it all and they're all very proud. And, as well as having lots of fun (?) they also managed to raise over £1800.00 between them for various charities.<br /><br />Well done everyone!<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Just been to see <a href="http://www.stepfordwivesmovie.com/flash/index.html">The Stepford Wives</a>.<br /><br />I did think it was going to be a "chick flick", which is not a bad thing saying as I love chick flicks, but I have to say I think guys would like it too.<br /><br />Nicola Kidman looked a bit weird in it though, not quite sure why.  Maybe it was the short dark hair and she was a bit too skinny in it too.  Looked all long and lanky!<br /><br />Everyone should go and see it  :o) <br /><br />L x<br /><br />Oh and there's a cool twist at the end...<br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I'm all alone, Dan has left me!  :o(<br /><br />Dan is off on his <a href="http://logicalgenetics.com/longwalk.php">long walk</a> this week so I'm home alone.  The house is very quiet and there's nothing much on the telly so I'm bored!  I must be bored becuase tonight I'm off to the <a href="http://www.davidlloydleisure.co.uk/clubs/club_details.php?club_id=18">gym</a>!<br /><br />Well, when I say gym that is technically where I'm going but maybes not for the right reasons. I have a sunbed booked.  I am wondering if I should go in the gym, for a bit at least, or maybes just for a swim (or even a jaquzzi, steam and sauna)<br /><br />I'm off to the <a href="http://www.myvue.com/cinemas/index.asp?SessionID=0660930123904BF5A49E392844E7CF53&amp;ci=38">flicks</a> tomorrow night with Laura to see <a href="http://www.stepfordwivesmovie.com/flash/index.html">The Stepford Wives</a> and then I've got 2 days off work to go down to Cornwall and meet the walkers so there's just tonight I need occupied.<br /><br />L x<br /> <div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

I did however manage to find the famous <a href="http://www.thehill.co.uk/photos.htm">blue door</a> (which isn't actually blue now) and the shop where William bumps into Anna (and spills orange down her) which has now become a coffee republic!<br /><br />Pictures coming soon...<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Last night myself, Dan, Ron, Jo & Skene went to the <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/SHWebClass.asp?WCI=ShowCat&amp;CatId=235">The Great British Beer Festival</a> at <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/SHWebClass.asp?WCI=ShowCat&amp;CatId=235">London Olympia</a> in Kensington.<br /><br />I've never been to the Olympia before and was amazed to see it was so big inside, and full of beers!<br /><br />I set Dan a little challenge whereby he had to drink a beer from each of our home counties. They had beers from both his nearest brewery in <a href="http://www.southwell-online.co.uk/">Southwell</a> and my local brewery in <a href="http://www.paulperry1.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/">Jarrow</a>! I was very impressed when I saw that one on the list! The challenge went well and he didn't actually hate any of the beers :o) I didn't do as well with my choice of cider. I did try a Perry though and it was actually my favorite one of the night.<br /><br />It was a good night and I'm now a big fan of beer festivals (for the cider of course!)<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Wow!  A whole weekend of sunshine!  Could it really be summer?<br /><br />On saturday we had a bbq which involved lots of eating and drinking. My cool 70's style punch bowl made is debut apperance and was filled with my own special Sangria (made with dregs of alcohol we had left over) It tasted fab and looked fantastic! :o)<br /><span style="font-family:monospace;"><br /></span><img src="http://lornaland.co.uk/photos/random/punch.jpg" alt="Lorna makes some punch" /><br />Me and my supa dupa punch bowl filled with yummy Sangria<br /><span style="font-family:monospace;"><br /></span><img src="http://lornaland.co.uk/photos/random/ronpunch.jpg" alt="Ron drinks some punch" /><br />Ron drinks a pint of punch<br /><span style="font-family:monospace;"><br /></span><img src="http://lornaland.co.uk/photos/random/danhat.jpg" alt="Dan and his hat" /><br />Dan likes his new hat<br /><br />The night was finished with a trip to <a href="http://www.theafterdarkclub.com/index.html">The After Dark Club</a>, somewhere I don't normally go but was lurred by their 80's night and have to admit, even though it's a manky club, the music was good and I had a great time dancing.<br /><br />Sunday started with a clean up session which didn't actually take too long (thank god for dishwashers) There was a quick trip into town for some Hagan Dazs ice cream, banoffee and strawberry cheesecake to be precise and to purchase some <a href="http://www.argos.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10001&langId=-1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;catalogId=2501&productId=108072&amp;Trail=C$cip=16448%3EC$cip=16506&amp;categoryId=16506">walkie-talkies</a> for <a href="http://www.logicalgenetics.com/longwalk.php">Dan's walk</a>.  The rest of the day was spent sitting around the garden relaxing and reading my Harry Potter book.<br /><br />Is amazing how much difference the sun makes!  :o)<br /><br />L x<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
