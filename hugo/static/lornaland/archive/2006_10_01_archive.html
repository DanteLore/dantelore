      <div style="clear:both;"></div>How does it happen that it comes round so fast!<br /><br />Had a drink filled weekend though starting with dinner and drinks in town.  We met George & Richard at <a href="https://www.readingrestaurants.com/sweeney_todd/">Sweeney &amp; Todd's</a> for some yummy pie (steak and ale) before heading off for drinks in the <a href="https://readingpubs.co.uk/pubs/showpub.asp?pub=Allied+Arms&postcode=RG1+2LG">Allied Arms</a>, where we met up with Jason and Rodney (housemate of G&amp;R).  When they kicked us out there at 12.0pm, we crossed the road to <a href="https://readingpubs.co.uk/pubs/showpub.asp?pub=Pavlov%27s+Dog&postcode=RG1+2LN">Pavlov's Dog</a> until we got chucked out at 2.00am.<br /><br />Saturday we woke up late (just seeing the morning) before settling down with breakfast to finish watching Lost.  Then we carved a pumpkin ready for Debbie &amp; Jason's Halloween party that evening.<br /><br />Jason's friends headed off to the (evil) <a href="https://www.theafterdarkclub.com/">After Dark</a> club around 11.00pm leaving me, Dan, Debbie &amp; Jason to spend the next 3 hours with Singstar!  :oP<br /><br />Once home I decided to watch the x-factor result show while Dan headed off to bed.  The next thing I know it was 4.30am and I woke to find the Emmerdale omnibus on (how many times must it be on over the weekend!) so I crawled up to be.<br /><br />Sunday was full of excitement with a trip to Tesocs.  We did buy the ingredients for a very tasty roast pork dinner complete with homemade stuffing and yorkshire puddings.<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Had the day off yesterday to watch my Daddy be a train driver for the day at the <a href="https://www.eastsomersetrailway.com/">East Somerset Railway</a>.<br /><br />I’d always said I was going to buy him a steam train driving day for his 60th and since he became a pensioner in August, that’s exactly what I did, although he had to wait until October before he got to go.<br /><br />We travelled across to Shepton Mallet in Somerset on Tuesday evening to meet up with my Mam and Dad.  We’d booked a room at the Burnt House Farm B&amp;B for the night to avoid having a early morning drive.<br /><br />Dad had to report for duty at 9.00am at the Engine Sheds on Wednesday morning and spent the next 3 hours getting the engine ready.  There were 3 trains during the day – 12.00pm, 1.30pm and 3.00pm.  Due to legal/insurance/red-tape issues, he wasn’t allowed to drive any of these trains but was on the footplate helping with the fire, signalling and coupling of the train.  But between the 1.30pm and 3.00pm train, he got to be driver for me, Dan and my Mam only.  I was lucky and allowed to ride on the footplate too with him so could watch him in action as he drove the train.<br /><br />Dan was feeling left out but he got to ride on the footplate on the last train so he was happy too!<br /><br /><img src="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/traindriver.jpg" alt="traindriver.jpg" /><br />Train Driver Daddy<br /><br /><img src="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/trainday.jpg" alt="trainday.jpg" /><br />Happy Daddy<br /><br /><img src="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/uploads/traincrew.jpg" alt="traincrew.jpg" /><br />The Train Crew<br /><br />You can see all the photos from the day <a href="https://www.lornaland.co.uk/photos/index.php?aid=62">here</a>.<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Yep, a whole weekend watching Lost! 8 episodes on Saturday and 6 on Sunday.<br /><br />We did leave the house a couple of times – once on Saturday to pay a visit to Sainsburys in town to stock up on wine and nibbles for our evening viewing session and once on Sunday to enjoy a couple of drinks in the Slug before heading back home for dinner and more Lost!<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Went into town on Friday night for some drinks. Met Tim in the Slug and Lettuce for a burger and then went off to meet Richard & George in the Oakford Social Club, formerly known as The Forum.<br /><br />I'd never been in before so couldn't tell the difference but it looked nice although there were a few weird/freaky people in there. Not as bad as the Turtle though ;o)<br /><br />Don't know why it's called a social club, I never caught one game of bingo!  :oP<br /><br />Saturday night we went round to Richard &amp; George's for a few drinks. Abi and Guy were there too who were really nice and Abi certainly knows how to make an entrance. Stepping into the front room to say hello, the handle of the carrier bag she was holding snapping sending the contents crashing to the floor and smashing on the carpet. And yes, it made a mess - two bottles of red wine! I'm just glad it wasn't me!<br /><br />The next 30 minutes was spent pouring salt all over the floor, not quite knowing what to do other than that, then Guy got the 1001 and with a bit of elbow grease, it came clean. It was amazing! I think we need to get some of that stuff, it was truly a miracle!<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 weekend up north...
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Back home after a weekend "at home".<br /><br />My journey up was very random due to the extortionist cost of train tickets these days.  It's Ok if you know you want to travel in 10 years time but if you need to get anywhere quickly, you pay a hefty price.  I'd been looking at train fares from Reading and London up to Newcastle and was being quoted over £100 for a standard class return ticket.  So, I was on a mission to find a cheap way of getting up north.<br /><br />I was going up alone for a girls day out to celebrate Helen's 30th birthday so I started checking fares from stations around the Nottingham area as Dan was going to be spending the weekend at his Mam's.  Eventually, I managed to find cheap trains from Newark - £16 up and £21.50 back.  So the plan was to drive up to Newark on Friday and catch the train from there.  My cheap ticket did mean that I was on the 10.30am train back down on Sunday morning!<br /><br />Saturday was an all day sesh in Newcastle.  We met in Lloyds Bar on the Quayside at 12.00pm and I got picked up on Saturday evening at 12.45am! <br /><br />It was a great day and I managed to come home reasonably sober considering my 12.5 hour session!  :o)<br /><br />L x<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
