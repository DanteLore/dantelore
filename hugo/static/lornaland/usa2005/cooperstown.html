  <h2>Cooperstown</h2>
  9th September 2005

  <hr/>

<h2>Friday 9th September 2005</h2>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_1532.jpg"/>
Time to start out journey westwards.  We left Boston and headed towards Cooperstown, but only after
we'd purchased ourselves a road map of America.
</p>
<p>
We stopped only once on the way to visit <a class="links" taregt="new" href="http://www.howecaverns.com/">Howe Caverns</a>.  It was a strange attraction and the $18pp ticket
price seemed a little steep but we paid our money and prepared to make the most of it.
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_1530.jpg"/>
The tour in the caverns was very interested.  It lasted well over an hour included a boat ride along the
underground river and a walk through the "winding way".  Our guide Ashton had rehearsed her role well
and provided a few comedy phrases which though vaguely funny at the time, were taken literally by some
of those on our tour and repeated constantly.  Annoying, but funny!
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_1529.jpg"/>
After the tour, it was time to head over to Cooperstown.  We arrived at the <a class="links" target="new" href="http://www.lyoncher.com/bnb/">Lyoncher B&B</a> at 6.00pm and
were greeted by our host, Tom.
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_1548.jpg"/>
After a quick change, we headed into town to check out the sights.  We didn't have much time in
Cooperstown which was a shame.  We walked to Ostego Lake and around the main streets and the looked
for somewhere to eat.
</p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_1538.jpg"/>
<p>
Tom had recommended a few places for dinner so we wandered round and checked them out.  We eventually
decided on the <a class="links" target="new" href="http://www.hoffmanlanebistro.com/">Hoffman Lane Bistro</a>.  A very good choice.
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_1542.jpg"/>
The Bistro was very cool and the menu sounded yummy.  I decided that if I ever owned a restaurant, it
would be quite similar.  The highlight of the night (apart from the delicious food) was the table.  They
had the usual setup, linen tablecloth covered with a paper cloth on top but they also provided crayons.
At first we were very English about the whole thing and were afraid to do anything.  It started with a
small Union Jack flag by me and a picturesque scene from Dan but as the wine flowed, the doodles got
bigger and by the time the waitress had taken the main plates away, there wasn't much space left.
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_1540.jpg"/>
The food was very delicious and we blew a days budget on a 3 course meal.  For starters we had lamb kebabs
and mussels in garlic and white wine, followed by honey and herb chicken and a steak salad.  We finished
it all off with creme brulee and a chocolate mousse on Oreo cookie base.
</p>
<p>
After dinner we had a few beers in the Doubleday Cafe and watched some baseball on TV.  We got talking
to another customer who kindly explained the rules which helped.
