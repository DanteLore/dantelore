  <h2>San Simeon</h2>
  25th September 2005

  <hr/>

<h2>Sunday 25th September 2005</h2>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2145.jpg"/>
Today we left San Francisco.  First stop was to pick up our third and final car - Arnie Spovo, a
Chevrolet Aveo.
</p>
<p>
With the car all loaded, we set off to the Golden Gate Bridge, our first chance to cross it.  We pulled
into the lookout point on the other side for a view of the bridge and San Francisco's skyline.
<img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2129.jpg"/>After
photos, we headed back across the bridge to Lombard Street to drive down it.  I thought it was fun but
Dan was a little disappointed.
</p>
<p>
We headed out of San Francisco and onto the open road - Highway 1, the Big Sur coastline and according to
some, the most scenic road in the world.
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2138.jpg"/>
We stopped at various points along the way to check out the view and made a quick stop in Carmel,
where Clint Eastwood was once mayor.  It was a quaint little town full of posh boutiques so we popped
into a deli for lunch then left.
</p>
<p>
Tonight's destination was San Simeon, a small town on the big sur coastline created mainly to serve
nearby Hearst Castle.
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2148.jpg"/>
Our home for the evening was the <a class="links" target="_new" href="https://www.silversurfmotel.com/">Silver Surf Motel</a> which had cost us the grand total of $43.95 for the
night (approx &pound;25!)  There was a little delay with check-in due to them not being able to find our
reservation but when we finally got to our room, we were very impressed.  It was probably the nicest
room we'd had so far (not counting the Bellagio of course)
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2149.jpg"/>
There was time for a dip in the pool and a soak in the jacuzzi before dinner.  There wasn't a huge choice
for dinner but we made a good choice with the <a class="links" target="_new" href="https://www.cavalierresort.com/">Cavalier Best Western</a>.  A very tasty and cheap meal.  The
only downside was when they started to close around us and we still had a third of a bottle of wine left!
</p>
<p>
After a little stroll along the shore, we headed to be ready for an early start tomorrow.
