  <h2>San Diego</h2>
  27th - 30th September 2005

  <hr/>

<h2>Tuesday 27th September 2005</h2>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2196.jpg"/>
Another early start, another theme park.  Today we were heading south again to San Diego, our final
destination. First stop was <a class="links" target="_new" href="http://www.4adventure.com/seaworld/ca/default.aspx">Seaworld</a>.
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2200.jpg"/>
After the success of yesterday's breakfast, Dan wanted to go to Denny's again.  Luckily, there was a
Denny's on our street but we never got there.  The traffic was heavy and we couldn't get across it.  We
headed off in the other direction only to get lost in a one-way system and eventually gave up and
headed to the freeway.  <img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2213.jpg"/>
We thought we'd be able to find one on the freeway but couldn't seem to find one.
In the end we gave up looking and just decided to head off to the next service area and find some food.
As we pulled off the freeway, there it was.  Breakfast was the same as yesterday's and just as good.
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2222.jpg"/>
The drive to San Diego wasn't too bad and we arrived at Seaworld around 11.00am.  It was a red hot day
which was just as well as we managed to get we a lot throughout the day.
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2203.jpg"/>
We saw Shamu and his friends who were very cool as well as Clive and Seymour.  I got to feed and stroke
some dolphins but we missed the seal and Sea lion feeding.  One sea lion had obviously worked out that the
best way to get fed was to be cute so had mastered a pose on a rock.  Too bad there was no fish for his
efforts.
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2219.jpg"/>
At chucking out time we headed off in search of our hotel, the <a class="links" target"_new" href="http://www.baysideinn.com/">Best Western Bayside Inn</a>.  Considering
we had no map of San Diego we managed to find the hotel without any problems.
</p>
<p>
After a second early start and fun-packed day we were feeling extremely tired.  We were tempted to order
room service but managed to drag ourselves off to the hotel bar.
</p>

<h2>Wednesday 28th September 2005</h2>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2234.jpg"/>
Our first full day in San Diego and we treated ourselves to a nice lie-in and lazy morning.
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2229.jpg"/>
We headed down to the bay for a look about and stumbled across the Elephant & Castle pub which we
visited for lunch.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, we headed along the bay in search of the boat hire company.  <img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2226.jpg"/>
We'd decided to hire a
speedboat for an hour which although was rather expensive was very cool indeed.  It was scary at first,
especially when Dan was driving but when I got behind the wheel it was great fun.  We came across a
sleeping sea lion on our travels too.  <img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2223.jpg"/>
The hour went quite fast and it was soon time to return our boat.
</p>
<p>
Back on dry land we headed back along the bay stopping to look at the shops in Seaport Village where
<img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2231.jpg"/>I had another beer and Dan had a fruit smoothie.  After mooching about the shops we took a slow walk
back to the hotel where we had a dip in the pool before dinner.
</p>
<p>
After a very relaxing, chilled out day, we were ready to go off exploring for dinner.  We headed over
to the gaslight area and found a nice little Spanish restaurant.
</p>

<h2>Thursday 29th September 2005</h2>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2246.jpg"/>
It's our very last day!  Four weeks have gone over in a flash!
</p>
<p>
To celebrate our last day in America, we headed down to Mexico for the day.  We hopped on the trolley
car down to the end of the line where it was just a short walk over to Mexico.
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2253.jpg"/>
Getting into Mexico was the weirdest experience.  You follow signs for a car park, cross over a bridge
and you're in.  No-one looks at your passport, we only saw one customs official and he was reading his
paper.  Once in Mexico though, everything's different.
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2254.jpg"/>
There was a huge crowd of taxi drivers waiting around offering to take you to the centre of Tijuana.
On advise of the guidebook, we'd decided to make the short walk instead and save our money.  The walk
was quite easy and we got to get 2 margarita's for the price of 1.  They were huge too!
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2249.jpg"/>
We spent the next few hours strolling along in the baking hot sun being hassled to go into shop after
shop.  We obliged to most and haggled for various things including some tequila with a worm inside.  We
only encountered one real tourist rip-off where having stopped for some more margarita's, the bar owner
poured tequila into our mouths before we knew what was happening and then demanded we pay for them!
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2255.jpg"/>
Eventually we were out of money and so we headed home
</p>
<p>
To celebrate our last night we set off back to the gaslamp quarter for somewhere nice to eat.  We found
a very nice looking Chinese restaurant called the <a class="links" target"_new" href="http://www.bluegingersd.com/">Blue Ginger</a> and weren't disappointed.
</p>
<p>
After dinner, we headed home to bed.
</p>

<h2>Friday 30th September 2005</h2>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2258.jpg"/>
Time to leave the USA.
</p>
<p>
We were booked on the 3.35pm BA flight from LA so set off early for the drive up to the airport.  We
needed to stop at a beach en-route so Dan could finish his mission, plodging in both the Atlantic and
the Pacific.  <img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2260.jpg"/>
We found a beach and spent half an hour walking along.  Dan got a bit wetter than he'd
planned so we had to dig about for a dry pair of shorts and a place for him to change.
</p>
<p>
We arrived at LAX just before 1.00pm and were met with a huge queue.  The airport system at LAX is very
strange and involves you checking in and having your bag weighed, they then give it back to you for you
<img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2259.jpg"/>to go and queue for it to be put through security and wait until it's given the all clear.  We'd planned
to be at the airport 3 hours before departure to enable us to have lunch before we left but all we managed
to do in the 2 and half hours we had was queue.  By the time we were finished, we had enough time to get
through sectary and to the gate in time for boarding!
</p>
<p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2261.jpg"/>
On board, I was sat to a very strange American girl who looked like it was her first time on a plane.
Luckily she went to sleep pretty quickly unlike me who spent most of the flight awake.
</p>
<p>
We landed back into Heathrow around 10.00am on Saturday 1st October, our American Adventure was over.
