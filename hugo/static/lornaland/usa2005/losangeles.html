  <h2>Los Angeles</h2>
  26th September 2005

<h2>Monday 26th September 2005</h2>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2175.jpg"/>
It was a very early start this morning.  We were up and away by 5.00am!
</p>
<p>
Today we had decided to visit a theme park in LA which gave us two options, Disneyland or Universal
Studios.  <img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2173.jpg"/>
I really wanted to go to Disneyland but it was around another 45 minutes on top of our
journey time which we'd estimated at 6 hours.
</p>
<p>
We stopped en-route for breakfast at Denny's and both opted for the $4.99 meat lovers breakfast - bacon,
sausage, 2 eggs, toast and a 3 stack of pancakes.  Good stuff!  Dan wanted to know why this was the
first Denny's we'd been to.
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2163.jpg"/>
We finally made it <a class="links" target="_new" href="http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/hollywood/website/index.html">Universal Studios</a> at 11.00am.  We decided to splash out and buy the "front of line"
pass which allowed us to do just what it said.  It was slightly more than the normal admission but we
thought it would be fun, and the nice people in front had a spare money off coupon so we thought we
might as well.
</p><img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2171.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside the park we headed off to enjoy the many rides.  First up was Back to the Future, Jurassic Park
and the Mummy.  Back to the Future seemed a little "old" but I guess it's to be expected as the film
is 20 years old.  Jurassic Park was wet and the Mummy was a little scary but great fun.
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2161.jpg"/>
Next stop was the Back Lot Tour.  We got to see the plane crash scene from War of the Worlds and found
out that it was a real plane they'd used to cut up!  As Universal is a working studio we were told that
there were times on the tour when we'd go through quiet zones as people were filming.
<img class="rightpic" src="IMG_2156.jpg"/>I was very excited
when they told us Desperate Housewives and CIS was being filmed today and craned my neck to see if I
could see anyone but I never did.
</p>
<p>
We managed to see everything in the park and go on all the rides at least once.  When the park shut, we
headed over to our hotel, the <a class="links" target="_new" href="http://www.travelodge.com/Travelodge/control/Booking/property_info?propertyId=09468&brandInfo=TL">Travelodge Sunset La Brea</a>.
</p><img class="leftpic" src="IMG_2180.jpg"/>
<p>
We'd planned on going to Miyaki's for dinner this evening but after the early start and fun-packed day
we decided to find something nearer the hotel.  There wasn't a lot to choose from and we ended up in
Hooters, so at least Dan was happy!  Though he kept complaining that the waitresses had "false legs".  We
had a look at the hand and foot prints outside Mann's Chinese Heater before heading home to bed.
