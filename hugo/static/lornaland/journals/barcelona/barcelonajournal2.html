<h3>Thursday 26th February 2004</h3>

<p>
<img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004574.jpg"/>
We wake up to rain and a horrible red itchy rash!  It's all over my arms, stomach andback of my hands!  :o(
</p>
<p>
<img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004602.jpg"/>
We set of to Montjuic, home of the Barcelona olympics & decide to take the cable car up.  We get half way to the cable car
station when we realise it's not open due to the pouring rain.  Half an hour after leaving the hotel and Dan's feet
are soaking!
<img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004581.jpg"/>
We arrive at Montjuic and it's got the coolist thing ever, outdoor escalator's which a start button!
</p>
<p>
We head up the hill to Poble Espanyol, an artificail Spanish village which should actually be called "Trap Touristique".
Poble Espanyol is full of little shops and restaurants selling overpriced goods and food to tourists who have already
paid 7 Euros to get in.
<img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004604.jpg"/>
After our overpriced lunch of french bread pizzas, beer, wine, coffee and a "gofre" (waffle
with chocolate and cream on - YUM!) we wandered back up the hill to Estadi Olympic (The Olympic statdium)  It's much
smaller than I expected for a 65,000 seater stadium.
</p>
<p><img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004584.jpg"/>
By this time we've walked miles and are very wet so we decide to head back to the hotel.
</p>
<p>
After our success with the guide books reccommendation for dinner last night, we decide to put our faith in it
again and look for a nice tapas bar to try.
<p><img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004600.jpg"/>
We choose a couple of tapas bars to check out in the Barri Gotic
which were very near to eachother.  It was raining heavier now and by the time we got to the right street we
were soaking wet!
<p><p><img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004597.jpg"/>
More bad news to come when we realised one of the bars was shut and we couldn't find the
other one.  We set off in seach of somewhere selling food but without much success.  We stumbled accross what
seemed to be some kind of protest in one of the squares.  Loads of poeple had gathered and there was much shouting
and singing and even some TV cameras but everything was happening in Spanish so we couldn't understand and all the
brolly's were obstructing our view.
</p><p><img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004605.jpg"/>
<p>
Having walked a bit further on, and now very very wet, we found a nice looking restaurant called "El Gran Cafe".
It turned out to be a very nice meal in the end, once we got out of our moods!  Nice wine, nice food and a man
playing the piano (and 2 Essex wannabes drinking half bottles of champagne sitting next to us!)
</p>
<p><p><img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004611.jpg"/>
We left the restaurant in search of a bar to have a little nightcap before bed, something there doesn't seem to
be many of in Barcelona, well, not many other than Irish bars or ones that just look *really* scary!  After a very
nice jug of sangria, it was time to go home to bed.

  <h3>Friday 27th February 2004</h3>
</p>

<p><p><img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004619.jpg"/>
Woke this morning still with an itchy rash, and Dan a litlle bit hungover!
<p><img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004628.jpg"/>
It's our last full day in Barcelona and it's finally stopped raining.  There's a bright blue
sky outside.  Hurrah!
</p>
<p>
First stop this morning was Guadi's "Park Guell".  It was a lovely little park with cute gingerbread style houses.
The views of Barcelona were fantastic too.
</p><p><img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004654.jpg"/>
<p>
Next stop was "Camp Nou" home of FC Barcelona.
<img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004665.jpg"/>
We decided to go on the guided tour as they take you into the changing
rooms, press rooms, onto the pitch, into the players bar and into the director's box.  The stadium is massive and seats
100,000 people.  They have a strage way of keeping the birds off the ptich though.
<p>
They do it by firing a cannon sound
<img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004659.jpg"/>
every few minutes which scares the birds away and also scares the tourists!  It was very interesting and I was lucky
enough to
<img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004670.jpg"/>
see on of the playerers (or so the guide told me but I didn't have my glasses on so couldn't quite see him
properly)  He did tell me his name but I forgot that too!
</p>
<p>
After a bite to eat at Pan's & Co (a catalunya style fast food joint, bit of a cross between Subway and Burger King) we
headed off to see some more of Guadi's houses.  We didn't actually go in any of them due to the extorshonist price they
charged you.
</p><img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004684.jpg"/>
<p>
In the evening we head off in search of "Toscano Antico" bar which is owned by a friend's neice.  We had a taste of the
yummy cocktails (in particular the Moulin Rouge which was very nice indeed)
<img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004688.jpg"/>
before we went to dinner.  We decided tonight
to try "L'Hostal De Rita" which is a sister restaurant to "La Fonda" which we tried on Wednesday night but like the other
restuarant, it was very busy and had a long waiting line.  We headed back to the Barri Gotic and

<h3>Saturday 28th February 2004</h3>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004696.jpg"/>
It's our last day in Barcelona.  We skip breakfast in favour of a lie in.  Still got my rash!  After
we've packed we head off for our last stroll around Barcelona.  It's blue skies and no rain so we
walk along the harbour to the beach.  It's a bit too cold for a swim so we stand on the sand and
take pictures instead.  We then head off for a final stroll down the Ramblas.
</p><img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004701.jpg"/>

<p>
We decide that we really should try some tapas in Spain so we start the search for somewhere to eat.
We find a not-so-scary looking place towards the top of the Ramblas and with a little help from the
phrases in the guide book we're just about managing to work out the menu when the waiter comes along
and offers to help.  He kindly asks if we like meat or seafood and says
<img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004717.jpg"/>
he will bring a selection for
us to try (Dan gets octopus, prawns and crab and I get meatballs, ham and potatoes)  It's quite nice
(except for the prawns) but not so nice when we get the bill!  The nice friendly waiter has charged us
53 Euros for it!  (That's about £40 in old money) and that's for a "light lunch!"
</p>
<img class="rightpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004720.jpg"/>
<p>
2 hours and 20 minutes to take off and we're sitting on the train to the airport.
</p>

<p>
5.05pm - Departure time and we're still in the airport with no plane.  It would seem that bad weather
in Newcastle has caused the plane to be delayed.  With not much news on the screens we take up a seat
in the bar and wait (I do happen to bump into 2 old school teachers, Mrs Dunn and Mrs Scullion in the
toilets though!!)  A phone message from mother keeps us in the picture, heavy snow in Newcastle has
caused the plane to Barcelona to be delayed.
</p>
<img class="leftpic" src="http://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/barcelona/tn_IM004724.jpg"/>
<p>
7.45pm - We finally depart Barcelona
9.30pm - We're about 150 miles from Newcastle and just starting our decent.  Should be back in
Newcastle at 9.00pm (that's 9.00pm English time)
</p>
