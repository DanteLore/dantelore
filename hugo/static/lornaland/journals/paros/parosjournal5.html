<h3>Wednesday 2nd June 2004</h3>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005156.jpg"/>
Guess what, another lazy day by the pool! (and some packing)
</p>
<img class="rightpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005158.jpg"/>
<p>
At 4.00pm (are we predictable or what!) we headed into town for a last mooch about and to see the church of a million doors, or one-
hundred, or in fact 99!  Walking through the old town we stumbled on some shops and restaurants we'd never seen before.
</p>
<p>
We walk along the seafront and along to the other side where we hadn't yet ventured.  The windmill at the end it seemed was a bar so we stopped for
a drink. It was one of the hottest days of the holiday so far so it was 7.00pm before we knew it.  Heading back home, we stopped
<img class="leftpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005183.jpg"/>
off at the supermarket for some souvenir shopping.
</p>
<img class="rightpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005190.jpg"/>
<p>
For dinner, we head back to the part of the old town which we'd just discovered and found a very nice restaurant called "Dionysis"
with a nice garden.  We had saganaki and tzatziki to start followed by mousaka and a free dessert!  :o)  After dinner we headed to
the "Saloon D'Or" for a drink but ended up having 3.  It was fast approaching 1am and with no room in Dan for any more food or beer
we headed home to bed.

<h3>Thursday 3rd June 2004</h3>

<p><img class="leftpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005197.jpg"/>
Rudely awakened at 6.30am by the alarm clock.  Today was our trip to Delos and Mykonos and we had to be at the windmill in town for
8.20am.
<img class="rightpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005205.jpg"/>
The bus took us to Noussa to catch the boat but it was high jacked by some French tourists (French SAGA) with a very rude
and annoying tour guide!
</p>
<p>
The boat to Delos took just over an hour and we arrived in Delos at 10.20am, which gave us 3 hours to look
round.
<img class="leftpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005210.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
It was very hot and luckily, Dan let us off climbing up to the highest point.  Dan found lots of things to take photos of and
took advantage of the many flashcards.
</p>
<img class="rightpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005270.jpg"/>
<p>
Back on the boat, it was a quick hop over to Mykonos.  First stop, as usual, was a taverna for some lunch and we found out that our
trusty guidebook was indeed right, Mykonos is expensive.  20 Euros for lunch!
</p>
<p>
We wandered round the old town which was just the same as all the other towns, lots of white buildings and little streets to confuse you!
(except not many of the other old towns have a
<img class="leftpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005261.jpg"/>
"ramrod" bar!)
</p>
<p>
During our wander, we stumble across a photo shoot although from what they were wearing, it wasn't very clear as to
where the photos would be seen.
Very hot, we stopped for another drink before it was time to board the boat and head back to Paros.
</p>
<img class="rightpic" src="https://logicalgenetics.com/pictures/paros/tn_IM005284.jpg"/>
<p>
It's our last meal and the decision about where to eat was quite tough.  Eventually, we decided to head into the market square and
back to the "Argonauta" restaurant (where we went on the 23rd May)  For dinner we have tzatziki, bread, spicy cheese dip and a
Greek salad to start (well, it was the last opportunity to have them and why break the habit of a lifetime!) followed by beef stifado.

</p>
<p>
After dinner, we had a little stroll along the seafront for the last time before heading home for bed.

Time to go home, and another 6.30am alarm call!  The coach was picking us up at 8.10am to take us to Noussa to catch the boat.
We arrived in Mykonos at 10.20am and it was straight onto the coach to the airport.

precise)  Due to arrive in Gatwick in about 35 minutes.  We've had our lunch of shepherds pie, broccoli and carrots with a very
nice "chocolate ugly fudge cake" and a glass of red wine,
</p>
<p>
1.55pm UK time (3.55pm) The captain has announced we are starting decent and we're currently flying over Paris!
