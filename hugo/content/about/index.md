Hi, I'm Dan.  I run Data teams for a living and I'm a huge fan of all things data-driven.  
I'm equally excited by the really simple things Data can do, like telling you how many widgets to order
or how much money you spent on mcguffins last quarter, as I am about the 'clever' stuff like machine
learning and AI.

In my spare time I like tinkering around, making stuff. Anything from flying machines to steam engines
to simple stuff like shelves and cupboards. I own an ex-RAF Land Rover which I restored to working order 
over a decade ago.  I guess I'm living proof that you can learn to do pretty much anything if you 
watch enough YouTube videos!

I do a few software projects on my own time too, I'm particularly proud of the neural network face 
clustering project and I always love working with open data sources, especially geospatial data.

I tend to blog randomly about all these things - sometimes just to record an achivement, sometimes to 
remind me how I did something, so this site is a bit of a mix or random stuff.

This site goes by a couple of other names too - formerly it was logicalgenetics.com and some 
of the more Land Rover-centric posts came from danandtheduke.co.uk.
