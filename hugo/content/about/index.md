Hi, I'm Dan.  I run Data teams for a living and I'm a huge fan of all things data-driven.  I'm equally
excited about the everyday things data can do for you, like telling you how many products you sold last month
or how much money you spent on widgets last quarter, as I am about the 'clever' stuff like machine
learning and AI.

In my spare time I like tinkering around, making stuff. Anything from flying machines to steam engines
to simple stuff like shelves and cupboards. I own an ex-RAF Land Rover which I restored to working order 
over a decade ago.  I guess I'm living proof that you can learn to do pretty much anything if you 
watch enough YouTube videos!

I do a few software projects on my own time too, I'm particularly proud of the [neural network face 
clustering project](/posts/face-clustering-with-neural-networks-and-k-means/) 
and I always love working with open data sources, especially geospatial data.

<script type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function() {
  oneDGA(".js_target", 240, 180, false);
};

I tend to blog randomly about all these things - sometimes just to record an achivement, sometimes to 
remind me how I did something, so this site is a bit of a mix or random stuff.

This site goes by a couple of other names too - formerly it was logicalgenetics.com and some 
of the more Land Rover-centric posts came from danandtheduke.co.uk.
