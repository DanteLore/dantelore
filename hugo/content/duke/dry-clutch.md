Investigated the spongy clutch this evening.  Hopefully the problem is this ill-fitting lid, or perhaps the fluid has just run out over seven or eight years of standing still.  Of course, there's also the possibility that it's leaking like a Reading Festival urinal.

Once I removed the lid - with mole grips - I found enough crystals to keep the Aztec Zone in business for several seasons but very little clutch fluid.  This explains a lot!

So hopefully, a quick beeding will sort it out.  Might also need a new master cylinder, if I can't find a new lid.
