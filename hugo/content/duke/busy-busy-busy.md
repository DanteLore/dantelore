After a weekend of "Duking", I can honestly say that I prefer the big scary tasks to the pesky odd jobs.  I also hate doing anything with bodywork and am getting pretty fed up of the electrics too!

Anyway, this weekend I have...
<ul><li>Bolted the roof on</li><li>Fitted reflectors</li><li>Bolted the bulkhead to the outrigger</li><li>Welded the door bottoms</li><li>Attached the seat belts</li><li>Fitted a new ignition lock and a new lock in the rear door (so there's one key for doors and one for the ignition)</li><li>Put the doors back on</li><li>Fitted the door tops and the crappy Britpart window latches</li><li>Wired up the tail lights
</li><li>Wired up the number plate lamp (so I now have a full set of rear lights!)</li><li>Fixed the speedo connector (which was snapped)</li><li>Mounted the fog warning bulb next to the fog light switch
</li></ul><a href="http://danandtheduke.co.uk/uploaded_images/IMG_0905-790670.JPG"><img src="https://dantelore.com/images/busy-busy-busy/IMG_0905-790630.JPG"/></a><span style="font-size:85%;">Tail lights, number plate lamp, oh, and a door too!</span>

But, in true Land Rover style, I found a load of other tasks which need to be done before the MOT...
<ul><li>I've wired up the headlights wrongly - so I need new plugs for the bulbs.</li><li>I've lost the fuel tank bolts and rubber spacers</li><li>The tiny screws which attach the fuel pickup to one of the tanks are bent and need replacing</li><li>The brake light switch is broken.  It works sometimes, but I'd prefer it to work all the time!</li><li>The driver's door is badly bent and is really hard to shut.  Needs new fixings and maybe even a new door bottom :o(</li><li>The passenger door check bracket snapped!</li><li>The fog light only comes on when using dipped headlights - goes off with beam!</li></ul>

<span style="font-size:100%;">
So, lots more to add to the To Do list, but lots crossed off too!
