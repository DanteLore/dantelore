I never knew my Grandad - he died before I was born - but people always tell me we're quite similar.  This may have something to do with our shared obsession with tinkering, redness of hair and dashing good looks. 

Anyway, I was pretty chuffed when Mum sent through this picture (recently found in the family archives of our Canadian cousins) of him in what appears to be a Series 1!
