Following on from the work on the transfer case, this evening's task was to get the main gearbox to bits.  I was pleased to find that it's a newer fully <span>synchromeshed</span> version, which means it'll be a drop-in replacement for my current box where double clutching is an option rather than a necessity.

This was held in with about a pint of <span>loctite</span>.  Had to use the 18" breaker bar on the socket and hold the main shaft still with vice grips wedged against the bench.  Much grunting later I got it free.

The bearing feels smooth in the hand but there was a distinct rumble when the shaft was rotated in the gearbox itself.  Might have to invest in a new bearing.

Managed to catch and bag all the springs and <span>detents</span> which interlock the levers.  The selectors came out easily, but getting them back in could be a pain!</span>

This can only be replaced by heating the gearbox casing and drifting out the shaft.  Not in any way an easy job.
</span>
The guy who sold me the gearbox at <span>Sodbury</span> claimed to have refurbished it not long before his Land Rover was killed off by a rusty chassis.  I suspect that the reverse gear was just too much of a pain to replace when he did the job.
