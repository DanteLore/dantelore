My six-way light switch is a bit dodgy. It works, but when you move it to a new position you have to twiddle it about a bit to make a good contact. The lights flicker when you do this wiggling and there's no way that it's going to pass an MOT like that.

I got the switch off eBay, so I guess I could go the whole "bad feedback" route, maybe try for my money back. Then again, the guy sold it to me "as seen" and didn't make any promises about it. After all, it does work... <span style="font-style: italic;">mostly</span>.

So, I decided to have a look inside tonight.  Here are some pictures.  Can't find any pictures on the web, so I've done a few in the hopes that they might help other people.

One of the wires seems to have got pretty hot in the past though.

The copper triangles are the contacts, which sit on three small springs each.</span>

Inside is the track that the contacts above run on and the contacts to the back of the switch.</span>

This metal spindle is the cause of my woes.  The two tabs plug into the <span>Bakelite</span> back plate (in the previous photo) to stop the spindle spinning.  The teeth on the spindle provide the six positions - a sprung ball bearing in the contact half of the switch assembly presses against the spindle and gives the clicking twisty action.  One of the tabs is broken on my switch, so it works, but the spindle wobbles slightly as it turns - just enough for the contacts to part company and thus, to make the lights flicker.
