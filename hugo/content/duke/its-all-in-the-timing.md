A bloke on the EMLRA forums had a rotor arm and set of points for the 24v distributor (found on the military 2.286 petrol engine) up for sale.  Seemed like a bargain so I snapped them up and this weekend (with a nasty cold) I fitted them to The Duke.

It was easier than I thought.  The components aren't too fiddly and because it's a military component everything is twelve times bigger and beefier than it needs to be.  The problem was that there doesn't seem to be a lot of information on the military distributor available online, so for most of the time I was flying blind!

As I said, there isn't much information available, so when setting the points gap I resorted to copying the settings for the civilian version - making the maximum gap about 0.4mm - a great excuse to use my feeler gauges for the first time!Refitting to the engine was a doddle.  The timing needed to be advanced further than usual for smooth running, but things sounded good at idle and under revs.  I did the timing by ear, which is probably bad but has always worked better than using the strobe.  We haven't been for a test drive yet because I felt like a badgers arse by the time all this was done, but hopefully there'll be a slight improvement.
