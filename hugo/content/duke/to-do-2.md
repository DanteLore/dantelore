Yet another To-Do list for the MOT...
<ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Attach fuel tanks - DONE</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Fix fault with fog lamp only coming on when headlights are dipped - AS DESIGNED</span>
</li><li>Work out why trailer warning light is always on</li><li>Wiper switch</li><li>Driver's door alignment</li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Washer tubing - DONE</span>
</li><li>Get tyres transferred onto wheels</li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Fit new seats - DONE</span>
</li><li>Brake light switch</li><li>Headlight wiring</li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Passenger door check rod bracket - DONE</span>
</li></ul>Doesn't look like much does it?  Suffering from the 80/20 rule pretty badly now though, each little job I do seems to take twice as long as the one before!
