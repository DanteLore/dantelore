Stayed in bed 'til 10:30 today because the weather girl told me it'd be raining all day.  As usual, she was completely wrong and I ended up outside all day getting The Duke back up and running.  Here are some pics...

A couple of "seams" interfere with the original inlet manifold, so I had to get the grinder out!

Started the engine without the exhaust and marvelled at the amazing noise!  Took a little while to get going, but when it did I suspect they heard the roar in Windsor.  Exhaust is now on and it purrs like a kitten.

Dead easy when you have the right tools.  Got a ball joint splitter from eBay which did the job perfectly.

Very productive day, all in all.  I am back on track with the original MOT list of minor jobs.  Still no sign of the Heritage Certificate...
