A while ago, you may remember, I had an <a href="http://blog.danandtheduke.co.uk/2010/03/kindness-of-strangers.html"><span>embarrassing</span> breakdown </a>caused by dodgy connections on the starter motor cable. Same thing happened the other day when I got home from work. It had been a hot day and the temporary insulation I'd put on the positive terminal had melted away enough to allow <span>this</span> starter to short again. This in turn had welded the nut to the terminal.

In the process of getting the nut off - which meant using the nut splitter in the end - I sheared the terminals inside the motor itself. Joy!

Luckily had a spare starter I picked up at <span>Sodbury</span> last year. After much swearing and finger bashing I got the old starter off and the new one on. Turned the key... nothing. The replacement starter was not a goer!

So the only course of action left open was to attempt a repair on the old starter. I used the replacement one (pictured above) as a donor to fix the connections on the known-good, old motor.

Note that the insulating bush is smashed to bits and the contact/tab is snapped.

I decided to use solder to get the resistance down as low as possible. It took quite a bit of heating with my crappy little iron to get the solder to bind to the tab and bar!</span>

Bolted the old starter into place and turned the key... nothing again! Some swearing and cursing took place. I unbolted the motor and turned the key again and it fired up fine. Back into place on the engine and everything worked. I can only assume that the gears had not lined up correctly the first time.So, now The Duke is back on the road and I know what the inside of a starter motor looks like!
