Busy day of Dukin' today.  Fitted the flywheel housing and new oil seal to the 200TDi the went outside to enjoy the sun and paint the rear crossmember - a job I've been putting off for over a year!﻿

Also, just for the record I fixed the brakes last week.  Turns out I'd cross threaded the pipe into the cylinder ages ago and it had finally worked itself loose.  Thank heavens for split circuit brakes!  Anyway, all fixed with a brand new cylinder now so we're back on the road!
