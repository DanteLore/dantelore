Still trying to get all the bits together to get The Duke's engine up and running.  The new distributor, leads, coil and plugs arrived this week, so I thought I'd have a look to see if they'd all fit properly.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Problem #1: </span> There is clearly something missing between the distributor and engine.  The Haynes manual mentions some kind of adapter but there are no pictures.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Problem #2:  </span>Got the spark plugs out to have a quick look.  Managed to get them out using a deep socket and my breaker bar, which saved buying a spark plug spanner.  However, the plug on the far left seems to be covered in oil - and there is oil on the engine round there too.  Hopefully this isn't indicative of some nasty problem.
