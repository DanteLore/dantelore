Popped to Halfords yesterday to get some axle stands, a four ton bottle jack and an 18 inch breaker bar.  This allowed me and Jay to get the front wheels off and investigate the brakes and drive train.

A mixture of good and bad news again.  I'm starting to think that everything on the 'drover is broken!

The brake drum took quite a bit of persuasion to get off, but once it was off I was very pleased to find that the axle itself was free and moved smoothly with no play.  The brakes have a good layer of pad left and the drum is clean and smooth.  The problem was the cylinders which both have crystalline deposits under the rubber seals.  I guess this means they've been leaking and will need replacing.

The wheel spins easily, again with no play, and the brake drum came off without a fight.  We tried some light pressure on the brake pedal and the pads moved outwards as expected, but the bottom one did not return completely.  Whether this is a fault or just because we'd pushed it out too far I do not know.  After pushing it back by hand the drum went back on fine.

So, slightly depressed that the brakes are going to need some serious attention - especially because it's a <span style="font-style: italic;">four spanner</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">job </span>according to the manual.  The good news is that the front diff seems fine!

Hopefully I have enough to finish the electrics and get the doors and locks fixed too. Then I'll start saving up for engine bits!
