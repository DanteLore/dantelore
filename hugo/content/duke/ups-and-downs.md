Spent a day doing some odd jobs with the assistance of Jason.  I spent most of my time poking about with my multimeter and he did some more satisfying hammer-oriented tasks.  Sadly, I think I found at least four additional problems for the list...
<ul><li>The prop shaft is bent.  I'd be willing to bet some large amount of money that I have <span><span>Witham's</span></span> <span><span>forklifting</span></span> to thank for this.  Maybe not the time we were watching, but the shaft is badly flattened and bent level with the chassis.  Annoying.</li><li>The locks on the front doors are broken.  Jason took them off for me and a quick comparison to the back door lock shows that they aren't closing properly.</li><li><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62oTnOHwOSo/SU7GXIA8EqI/AAAAAAAAAD8/SaUILfj4AwU/s1600-h/IMG_5377.JPG"><img src="https://dantelore.com/images/ups-and-downs/IMG_5377.JPG"/></a>The driver's door is badly bent.  Taking it off to get the wing mirror off revealed that the bolts attaching the door to the hinge were bent.</li><li>The "acorn nut" in the centre of the rocker cover is missing and the one at the back was loose.  This worries me a bit.  Had a quick peek under the rocker cover and all looks OK, but I couldn't get it all the way off.  I really hope the engine itself is alright!
</li></ul>The prop shaft is very depressing and the rocker cover worrying, but there were good points today too.
<ul><li>The wiring for the front lights, at least as far back as the engine seems OK.  Just need to trace the back lights and follow the wires into the dash.</li><li>Speaking of the dash, the new one fits fine.  Got a spare bit to give to Johnson too.</li><li>Checked the radiator and water reservoir and they were both full and there were no signs of leaks.</li><li>Confirmed that the starter motor and starter solenoid are present, which is nice!</li><li>Jason unbolted the generator panel and it really is as good as new!  No signs of heat anywhere and it even smelled new.</li></ul><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62oTnOHwOSo/SU7NqUFSN2I/AAAAAAAAAEM/DQxJmlDin-k/s1600-h/IMG_5371.JPG"><img src="https://dantelore.com/images/ups-and-downs/IMG_5371.JPG"/></a>The air filter seems good too.  I had to take it off to get my hands on the wiring going into the right hand wing.  The wire mesh inside has a fair sprinkling of grass seeds and the oil level has a little too low, but otherwise fine and dandy.

It's wired to the heater and was wrapped in some slightly charred cardboard so I <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> it's a resistor to allow a 12v heater on a 24v system.  It was just banging about in the engine compartment though.  Pretty shoddy!

The door top frames were totally screwed, but the glass may come in handy if I decide to get unglazed door tops to save cash or, more likely, I end up with a smashed window some time in the future!

By far the most positive thing of the day is that I managed to find some reasonably cheap military lens covers for the lights. Usually these cost £10-£15 each new and usually well over £5 second hand, so I was very pleased when I managed to find a set on EBay for £36 including shipping.  I got four indicators, two stop/tail lights and two reverse.  I'll need two more clear lenses for the side lights, but then I'm more or less done.  I'd expected to be spending £70+ on these, so I'm quite happy to get them half price!
