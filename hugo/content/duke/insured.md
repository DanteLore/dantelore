Just sorted out some insurance for The Duke.  Starts on Monday at midnight. 

Got it from Adrian Flux in the end, with a sizable discount for my EMLRA membership (so well worth the membership fee just for that).  Fully comp with legal and personal injury protection, 5000 miles a year of non-business travel and an agreed value of £2500... all for £140 for the year!

The plan to organise an age related registration before getting the MOT fell by the wayside when I phoned the DVLA to ask a few questions about the process.  Last time I phoned they told me I could do the transfer without MOT and insurance, this time they claimed I do need MOT and insurance.  So, I'm going to get an MOT on the Q registration, using the expensive Heritage Certificate as proof of age for the engine - thus ensuring that it gets tested against 1981 emissions standards.

Hopefully I'll be able to get the MOT booked in for next week some time.  I fully expect it to fail first time, probably on brake balance and some other stuff.  Even with one fail and a week of work to get back on the road, there's still a slim chance I might hit my 29th November deadline... fingers crossed!
