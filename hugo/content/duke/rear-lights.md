Just a quick post to say I'm almost finished with the rear lights.  The fuse box works well and looks reasonably smart mounted in the engine compartment.

Interesting, there are two wires in the loom which I can't find a use for!  I suspect they are trailer related, but can't be sure.  I made the new loom as an exact copy of the old rather than using the circuit diagram.  Anyway, I've left the cables disconnected and can attach them should I ever need them!

<span>Only</span> thing left to do on the rear loom is sort out the tail light connection in the military dash.  I disconnected this after the short circuit earlier in the year and now need to get it wired back in somehow!

Also mounted the headlight relays behind the air filter.  The tips of the self-tappers can be seen through the grille, so maybe should replace with nuts and bolts.  Will do for now though!
