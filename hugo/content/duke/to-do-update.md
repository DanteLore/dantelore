</span></li></ul>Small jobs, maybe I can get them ticked off tomorrow...

...OK, it's tomorrow now and I've ticked a good few of them off.  Heritage Certificate and subsequent visit to the DVLA in Theale are the limiting factor at the moment.

Glued the valance tabs back on in the end, but only one of them actually stayed (the F clamp slipped off half way and ruined the bond).  Hopefully the tester won't be fussed!

Also slightly worried about the brake balance, but I might just pay the garage to sort that - not sure I can be bothered!

Brake and clutch rubber pads are on order.  Need to measure the track rod clamps to see what length bolts are needed.  Must remember to do that this afternoon.
