Tom decided he doesn't like his billion quid's worth of machine tools, so they're coming to The Duke's new house for some kind of permanent loan arrangement. 

The lathe was the first thing to be transported today, it's very big and it weighs over 100kg.  So I built a ramp out of an old desk and got a winch off ebay.  Pete and Tom were kind enough to help me load up, but The Dukes Enhanced Loading System allowed me to unload on my own!  I just need somebody to help me lift the bloody thing onto its table!
