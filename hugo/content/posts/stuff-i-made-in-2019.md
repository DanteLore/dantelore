Every year I like to do a quick roundup of all the things I've made. Making stuff is important, and it's nice to
record what I've done for posterity.

## The cooker

Having made a kitchen sink for the school last year, I went on to make a play-cooker this year.  All made from scrap
wood and bits and bobs.

## The front garden

Kerb appeal!  This year's mamouth outdoor project was the front garden, where we cleared out a jungle of weeds and
put down two tons of gravel.  I also made a nice "bin area" and a patio/path in front of the door.  This was much
easier than the patio project and lawn from previous years, but still involved _a lot_ of digging!

## Random wooden things

Too many wooden things to mention!  A variety of boxes, some new mirrors for the bathroom, a sauce caddy for 
barbeques, which makes setting the table 100 times faster and some more "artistic" creations...

## The stool and the lamp

I'm super-happy with how these two projects turned out.  The combination of raw steel and oak is beautiful, even if
the overall quality is limited by my dodgy welding.

## Another shed!

Not content with a single shed, I built another, which houses general garden tat, bikes and a huge quantity of 
scrap wood for future projects.

## Router table

Routers are great, but really hard to use on small parts.  I started to find that whenever I used the router, it was
clamped upsidedown in a vise and I was risking my fingers feeding things into it.  After a little welding and bodging,
I now have a servicable router table, which makes these operations much simpler.

## Posh Picture Frame

Having made 20-something picture frames last year, this year I went for quality over quantity.  I made this one
from oak.  It's simple, but it's clean and neat and should last a very long time.  It was a pressie for the in-laws,
so had to be perfect!

## Lathe Revamp

Finally, after years of living with a broken lathe, I replaced the broken DC motor and controller with a shiny new
AC setup.  My budget would only run to 1 horsepower, so the lathe does tend to stall if I push it too hard, but it's
10x more usable than before.  First job was to turn a new pulley for the new motor...

Working in London eats up my time these days, so I managed much less than I wanted/expected to get done in 2019.
However, looking back at these pictures from across the year, I realise I still managed a fair bit.  Mustn't grumble!
