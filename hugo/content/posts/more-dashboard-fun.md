Got a new attachment for my <span>Dremel</span> on my way home today.  This allowed me to bodge some extra holes in the centre dash panel for the hazard switch and main lighting switch (the hole for which was too small).  Not massively proud of the results - I kept slipping!  Still, it won't look out of place when installed.

I had a major breakthrough with the hazard switch, which I thought was broken beyond repair.  The contacts were badly corroded which made the switch stiff and prevented a contact being made.  In a last ditch attempt to get it working I bunged it in some of Lorna's silver cleaning potion and now it's good as new.  Perfect contacts and it moves easily too.  Result!
