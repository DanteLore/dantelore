This evening I was innocently setting up a wireless dongle for my darling wife.  I casually typed in the address of this very web page into her browser to check it was working, only to find that all the posts were missing!

404 errors on every page but the front page.  Poo!  I desperately dived in to the wordpress settings, everything was set up fine.  I updated wordpress but it made no difference.  In the end, I went back to the post URL settings and clicked "Apply" again.  It fixed the problem!

Looking at the stats, Logical Genetics seems to have been off the air since Independence Day.  Almost a month.  Miserable.

Back now though, and soon to be posting an article on my Build Status Traffic Lights.
