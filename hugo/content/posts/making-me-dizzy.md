<span style="font-size:100%;">Just worked out costings for the ignition system parts needed for getting the engine going.  The difference in cost between genuine military bits and a hacked-together system with 12v parts is quite amazing...  </span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Original Military System with New/Reconditioned Parts:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">£295.52</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span></span><ul><li><span style="font-size:100%;"><a href="http://www.lrseries.com/shop/product/listing/14648/4232/2/552605-FFR-24V-COIL-FILTER-UNIT.html">Filter Unit</a>:    </span><span style="line-height: 27px;font-size:100%;" >£63.2</span></li></ul><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dodgy DIY System:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">£80.34</span>
</span><ul><li><span style="font-size:100%;"><a href="http://forum.landrovernet.com/showthread.php?t=143725">Filter Unit (2nd hand via forum)</a>: £15.00</span></li></ul><span style="font-size:100%;">It's sad that the price difference is so great, really.  I'd love to have replaced the parts with originals, but £200 is a lot of money and could be better spent on the rest of the engine parts I need (carb, hoses and whathaveyou).
