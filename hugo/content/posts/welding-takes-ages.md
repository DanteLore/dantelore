Good progress on the welding today.  Made a plate for the bottom of the chassis, welded side plates onto each side of that and then welded the whole thing onto the chassis.  Job's a good 'un!  Welding is bloody hard work though - I went through my last three grinding wheels and have a back ache and a white stripe on my face from the welding mask strap.

So, that's about a third of the welding I need to do.  Need to do exactly the same on the other side of the chassis, then patch up all the other little holes.  A good three days more hard work to do.
