Today, logicalgenetics.com and danandtheduke.co.uk merged to make one Super-Blog!  It seemed daft having two websites and two blogs, so I've pulled all the Land Rover posts into the Logical Genetics blog and pointed both addresses right here.  You don't need to change your bookmarks or format your brain - both logicalgenetics.com and danandtheduke.co.uk still work fine.

<a href="http://danandtheduke.blogspot.com">The old Land Rover blog</a> won't see any more action - I'll be posting everything here.  You'll still get all the mission reports and photos of mechanicals.  You'll also get weird posts about Software, Machine Tools, Multi-Rotors and model flight and, well, just about anything else I can dream up.

If you just want to read about Land Rovers or Adventures, use the "Blog Posts" menu at the top to choose your poison.

Enjoy!
