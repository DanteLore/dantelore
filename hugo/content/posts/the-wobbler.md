I made a Wobbler!  A single acting, oscillating air engine, to be precise.  I was inspired by the amazing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mrpete222">Tubalcain</a>, who's YouTube channel has been the source of many top tips and the cause of many late nights.  Though the design of the wobbler wasn't new to me, the old *Mamod* steam engine I had when I was a kid used the same principle.

The wobbler is probably the simplest engine design there is.  I tried to to a nice job of this one, though didn't go overboard with the look of the thing - I don't see the point of pretending it's not made from some bits and bobs I has knocking about in the garage!  Here are some photos:
