The quest to find out about The Duke's history makes for an interesting alternative to going outside when it's below freezing.   I got the log book through a few days ago, but it wasn't 'til today that I actually thought to look who the previous keeper was.

QinetiQ Ltd,
MOD Boscombe Down
Amesbury
Salisbury
SP4 0JF

On April Fool's Day, 1997, they registered him on a Q plate because the date of first registration was unknown.   Very interesting!  Didn't take long to find a map of Boscombe Down and work out some possible usages for a helicopter servicing platform:  The <a href="http://www.qinetiq.com/home_etps.html">Empire Test Pilot School</a> are both based at Boscombe Down and both fly Lynx helicopters.

Interestingly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Evaluation_and_Research_Agency">Defense Evaluation and Research Agency</a> was split up by the government.  I guess the company name was changed at the DVLA at some point.

Registration on a Q plate because the manufacture date is unknown is all fine and dandy, but <span style="font-style: italic;">why </span>was the manufacture date not known?  Normally, the military registration (52 AJ 79) is enough to trace this.  Also, the chassis number can be sent to Land Rover or the <a href="http://www.heritage-motor-centre.co.uk/shop/heritage-certificates/index.html">Heritage Motor Centre</a> to find out.  I guess some sloppy employee needed to get it on the road but couldn't be bothered to work it out.

Finally, Witham didn't mention that it wasn't a direct sale from the MOD.  Obviously they didn't say it <span style="font-style: italic;">was</span> an MOD vehicle either, but given that their website is entitled "MOD Sales" there's a strong implication!  Nothing massive to complain about I suppose, but slightly annoying.

So, I have one of the world's largest defence research establishments to thank for letting my Land Rover get rusty!
