Dr Johnson, Dr Kelly, my trusty assistant and I went for an early morning walk to the top of Beacon Hill this morning.  We began our climb at 7am sharp, leaving the noise of the Newbury Bypass behind as we clambered through the scrub.  The newborn sun cast a golden light upon the dew-soaked turf of the earthworks and a strong wind from the West made it almost impossible to fly a Tricopter.  Luckily, we had tea, coffee and cookies as well as the soothing tones of Dr K's Saxophone to keep us entertained.

Managed to record a couple of minutes of footage, but the wind made for a very bumpy ride and a nasty smudge on the camera lens puts a damper on the quality too.

The tricopter is still very down on power, especially with the newly-fixed GoPro and force 10 gale.  Maybe now is the time to convert it to a hexacopter... watch this space!
