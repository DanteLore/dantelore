Today, a pair of Reading's Finest turned up on our doorstep and scared the hell out of me!  "Are you the owner of a green Range Rover?", well, yes, I own a green <span style="font-style: italic;">Land</span> Rover.  "It's on the drive" I told them.  "Are you sure, Mr Taylor?  Do you want to check that?".  Normally that would have made me quite worried, but since The Duke is slightly less mobile than the Great Pyramid of Khufu, I just took them out to see it.

Apparently, a green Range/Land Rover has been found in another force area with The Duke's reg.  They seemed pretty happy that my version is the real one and didn't even want to see the log book.  I guess they're happy that it's my name on the DVLA database and the number plates match.

I guess that anyone who knew The Duke was parked up at BDAC would have known that the number plate was probably not going to be used again.

Anyway, the police said I was unlikely to hear anything else and that they would probably be impounding the other vehicle.  As long as they don't take mine, I'm happy!
