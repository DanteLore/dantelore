For some reason, I have started playing with <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/sylvaingi/2369589">this snippet on bl.ocks.org</a> but I made a few subtle changes to the code and the visual style.

<script type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function() {
  conway(".js_target", 120);
};
</script>

<div class="js_target"></div>

I don't take credit for much here - I just wanted to record that I'd spent a couple of train journeys building something cool!
