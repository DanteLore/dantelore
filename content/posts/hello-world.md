So, I've decided it's about time I reinvent Logical Genetics - again!  The site's been around for over a decade now.  I remember sitting in my freezing attic room, the year after I graduated, embarking on my PhD studies and trying to think of a cool name for a website to document my adventures in artificial intelligence.

As time went on I did some blogging and knocked up some articles.  Thousands of posts were written on the forums by me and a group of like-minded friends.  I presented at conferences and user groups, published papers and never once failed to promote the site.  I still get emails from lazy students asking for source code!

Since then, much has changed. I never finished my doctorate because to be honest, I'm an engineer not an academic.  I'm on my third job and have managed to pick up a wife and a daughter too.  I spend more time [blogging about Land Rovers](http://danandtheduke.co.uk) and tricopters than I do about genetic algorithms.  The invention of Facebook and Twitter killed off the social side of Logical Genetics and my job ate my spare time.  Years went by with no activity.

Recently though, I've switched jobs and found time for some interesting hobbies.  I've fallen in love with the Raspberry Pi and want to share my experiences using it with C# and mono because I'm sick of reading people's skewed opinions on the subject.  I also want somewhere to post about my continuous tricopter tinkerings and rant on the subject of software development and agile.  Plus I still knock up the odd evolutionary algorithm every now and again.

So the new-look Logical Genetics has a broader scope and is a bit more personal.  The old forums are still linked off the front page and I've kept some of the old articles too.  Lets's see where things go from here...
