Just finished my first attempt at an annotated circuit diagram for The Duke.  It's a copy of "Figure 150" from the military manual, but I've put as many notes on there as I can so I don't have to keep cross referencing.

<a href="http://www.landrover-uk.net/forum/showthread.php?t=132511">Land Rover forum</a>:  One bloke mentions the aux relay being used for "switching things that require both Ignition-on & the "Convoy Inhibit" off".  Sounds pretty sensible, but hard to get to grips with when the diagrams don't show which connections are which on the relays.

Anyway, that's what I've been doing today.
