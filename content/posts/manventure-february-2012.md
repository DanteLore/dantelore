Went away for a couple of days last weekend to Blaenavon in South Wales.  Had a brilliant time and managed to fit in a bit of green laning in West Berkshire on the way there and back.  Here's some pictures and there's a video too.

Boring video, I know, but the camera was only held on with gaffa tape and we were too scared to attach it to the bumper on any of the muddier and more exciting lanes!
