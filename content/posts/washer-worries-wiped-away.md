Wednesday: washers and wipers working, without wasting wonga on weplacements.

A new wiper switch is an expensive thing - £25 for a single speed and £35 or more for a two speed version.   Turns out The Duke has single speed wipers, but I have a two speed switch, which I got with the replacement dash (thanks again to whoever robbed the original!).

As I've mentioned before, the washer button which screws into the back of the switch snapped off,  then I managed to snap another one off another switch from a second dashboard.  I've been having problems trying to find a cheap fix ever since.  In the end I took the knackered wiper switch to Maplins to search for a momentary push-to-make switch that'd fit into the back.  Maplins being Maplins, I didn't find exactly what I wanted but this time I did find something to do the job...
