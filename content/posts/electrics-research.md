The first job to do is get the electrical system to a point where I can start work on the engine.  Since it's mid winter at the moment I don't want to spend too much time poking around under the bonnet, so working on the missing dash and belling out all the cables is a good way to make some progress without freezing to death.

The indicator stalk is pretty badly ceased too.  The radio panel has been removed, but most of the important relays and whatnot seem to be present.  Also, because the vehicle was supplied without keys, I need a new ignition switch.

I got a new dashboard off eBay a couple of days ago, but obviously it's a civilian version, so all the gauges are 12v and the wiring <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> be slightly different.

Lots to do!
