The 200TDi engine has an oil cooler which sits next to the radiator and is connected to the oil filter housing by a couple of flexible pipes.  The oil cooler is needed because the turbo allows a large amount of heat from the exhaust manifold to be transferred into the oil which needs to be lost somehow (the heat, I mean, not the oil!).  Since I'm fitting the TDi engine in non-turbo form I won't need the oil cooler (or even a fan for that matter!) so the thermostat in the oil filter housing needs to be removed and the pipe connections blanked off.

﻿So, unless it all leaks, that's one more task complete on the New Engine Project.  Good news.  Bad news is that I tried turning the engine over with the 24v starter (using The Duke's batteries and my new jump leads) this weekend.  The starter just doesn't seem to be up to the job.  It struggled to turn the engine over, probably due to the higher compression ratio of the diesel.  Another reason to move away from the 24v dream to 12v mediocrity...
