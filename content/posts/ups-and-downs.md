Spent a day doing some odd jobs with the assistance of Jason.  I spent most of my time poking about with my multimeter and he did some more satisfying hammer-oriented tasks.  Sadly, I think I found at least four additional problems for the list...
<ul><li>The prop shaft is bent.  I'd be willing to bet some large amount of money that I have <span><span>Witham's</span></span> <span><span>forklifting</span></span> to thank for this.  Maybe not the time we were watching, but the shaft is badly flattened and bent level with the chassis.  Annoying.</li><li>The locks on the front doors are broken.  Jason took them off for me and a quick comparison to the back door lock shows that they aren't closing properly.</li><li>[<img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62oTnOHwOSo/SU7Ws4cWsrI/AAAAAAAAAEs/AAfBicEH53U/s200/136d_1.JPG"/>](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62oTnOHwOSo/SU7Ws4cWsrI/AAAAAAAAAEs/AAfBicEH53U/s1600-h/136d_1.JPG)
