Ran out of welding wire today.  After a weekend of hardcore grinding and welding I got the last chassis plate fabricated and tacked on.  Almost finished the last of the welding - thank God - but there's a bit to do underneath so I'll need to splash out on more wire ASAP.

Got the engine running and worked through the gears.  Even in 4th with some throttle it was totally free of wobble.  Well worth the Â£20 I paid some bloke at Sodbury!

Still some welding to do, plus the suspension needs putting back together, the wiring loom needs to be constructed and attached, the chassis needs undersealing on the outside and waxoyling on the inside and then... only then... I can bung the tub back on!

And finally:  charging the batteries sorted the starting problem right out!  They took 12 hours each to charge - I guess I should do it more often!
