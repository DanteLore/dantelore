Few more hours of work today and the Petrol Engine is out.  Lots of things to disconnect then some serious hoisting and out it popped.  Also found another connector on the oil cooler and managed to get that off really easily.

Hopefully the weather will be on my side tomorrow and I can get the gearboxes swapped over.
