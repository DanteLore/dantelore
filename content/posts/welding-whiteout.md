Snow?  What snow?  Oh... that massive foot-deep layer of snow covering the whole of Reading.  Thanks to the bottomless positivity supplies of Doctor Johnson, the snow and negative temperatures did not stop further progress on The Duke.

</span>
Still a fair bit to do - the front <span>dumbiron</span> still has a big hole in it and the right hand outrigger needs welding back on.  After that I need to fix the driver's door lock which came back from the garage with a loose (and useless) handle.

Fuel tank seals are sorted and a completely new set of brakes are fitted but need a bit more bleeding to firm them up.

I've also ordered a set of new front springs after the good Doctor Johnson managed to snap the bracket when attempting to split them.  In a way I'm quite pleased to have an excuse to get new ones.  The work involved in a <span>refurb</span> would be far from minor and I'd much rather go for a quick fix and get the MOT done ASAP!
