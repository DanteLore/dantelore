The <span>XBox</span> is broken, there's nothing on the TV and the budget can't stretch to Land Rover parts til pay day.  Time for some shameless tinkering.

Spent most of the weekend clearing out the shed, which gave me the sneezes to end all sneezes and the headache to ruin all Saturday nights.  Thousands of spiders are now homeless, there's a boot load of crap waiting to go to the tip and every time I blow my nose, my <span>hanky</span> goes black.

That done, the tinkering could begin.  <span>Bitten</span> hard by the cleaning bug I spent most of my time putting stuff away, sweeping and screwing the dash back together.  Lorna still does a face when she looks at it, but I think it's looking pretty tidy in there now.
