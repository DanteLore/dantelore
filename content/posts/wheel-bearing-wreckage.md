<span style="font-size: small;">The Duke failed his first MOT of the year this Monday.  The news wasn't massively bad - just some play in the rear offside wheel bearing.  So I ordered the parts and took the day off to sort it out today.</span>
<span style="font-size: small;"></span><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YOhl0LRH0ZQ/TYPAN5cSt8I/AAAAAAAACRA/XHwiwKYtxgE/s1600/IMG_5705.JPG"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YOhl0LRH0ZQ/TYPAN5cSt8I/AAAAAAAACRA/XHwiwKYtxgE/s320/IMG_5705.JPG"/></a>The wheel had a really good wobble going on.  To be honest, it's a miracle it hadn't fallen off!  On the morning of the epic journey to my stag do last year, Dr J noticed that the hub on this wheel was loose - or at least the bolts weren't fully tightened.  While performing a roadside repair I snapped one of the bolts half way down.  Then we went away for the weekend and drank until the memory of the event was totally expunged.
