It's been absolutely beautiful weather for the last week or so.  Ideal for doing some work on The Duke.  The project is severely hampered, however, by the scarcity and cost of engine bits.  I'd really wanted to get the engine running before doing any other serious work, but I also want to hit my September deadline for the MOT.

So in the week, while gazing out of the office window looking at the sunshine, I decided to press on with what was originally Phase II: the Chassis.

As I've mentioned before, the rear <span>crossmember</span> and various other bits of the chassis are in a very bad way and need some serious work.  The wiring in the back needs completely replacing, and I need a new rear <span>propshaft</span> too.  So it seems like the best course of action is to strip off the roof and tub and strip the back down to the bear bones.

Step one is to remove the roof and walls - all in one go.  There were about 15 bolts in all, some in better condition that others but all pretty knackered.  It took me about an hour and a half to get them all done.  The rubber seal was glued down pretty well, but I managed to remove with some slightly non-standard jacking.

Ron popped round to lend a hand with the heavy lifting (and very heavy it was too, thanks to the chunky roof platform).  We gently lowered the roof off and propped it against the shed.

Lorna, who had spent the morning telling me she didn't like my dirty 'drover, was very very excited about the new <span>convertible</span> on the drive.  I have to say that he does look pretty cool with no top on.  On a day like today it's easy to imagine cruising around with the sun shining into the cab and a posse of mates in the back.  When the good weather leaves us I'm sure I'll want to put the roof back again!

Next job is the tub (the rear bulkhead, floor and all the bodywork beyond the seats).  <span>That'll</span> be a big job indeed!
