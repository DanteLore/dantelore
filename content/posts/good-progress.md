I got up early today - on a Saturday - to get a full day working on The Duke.  I've finished now, with seven hours of hard work done, a slight sunburn and a big smile on my face!  After a long soak in the bath I'm going to hit the beers and celebrate.

"Celebrate what?" I hear you cry.  Well, today I ticked off a fair few things from last week's To-Do list and I drove The Duke backwards and forwards a bit, which always makes me happy!

First off, I got the pressure washer out - kindly lent to us by Lorna's boss - and cleaned off the drive, the chassis and the underside of the tub.  With a nice clean surface to paint (decided to leave any old covering which withstood the <span>Karcher</span>) I could whack a thick coat of <span>underseal</span> on and get it looking smart.  Well, smart for the underside of a twenty year old car anyway!

I also got another coat on the rear of the chassis, which is now quite thickly smeared up with the stuff.  Special thanks go to the seagull which did a poo on the chassis just after I'd applied the final <span>brushload</span>!

Next on the list was the throttle linkage - <span style="font-style: italic;">huge</span> thanks to <span>Satancom</span> from the Land Rover Forums for sending me his old linkage.  I couldn't find the part number anywhere and was starting to worry, so his help was invaluable.  Even more kudos to him for asking only for a Â£5 donation to the forum - something I was happy to do.

Task number three was done while the paint dried - making up the rear wiring loom.  I used a couple of screws in the fence to fix the cables, in a poor attempt to copy the pin boards they use in cable factories (my week's work experience at 16 wasn't wasted after all!) then taped them all together with a whole roll of rubber binding tape.

Fixed it to the chassis with cable ties, adding a couple of clips of my own but mainly using holes already there.  I tried to follow the path that the brake pipes take, as I assume somebody at Land Rover thought they'd be in a safe place!

And finally, the biggest worry left on the project is now a thing of the past!  I got The Duke to charge his own batteries!  Decided that before I faffed about testing all the cables and components in the rather complicated charging circuitry, I'd try out the spare generator I got at <span>Sodbury</span> earlier in the year.  Guess what...  it worked!  I now get a constant 27.8v across the battery terminals when the engine is running.

This is a massive relief, as the unknown scares me a bit.  OK, I have half a degree in electronics, but I was far from happy with having to test the generator circuits out myself!  Having such a quick fix work first time is something to really be happy about!

All this good news obviously needs to be tempered with a bit of bad - and there was some bad news today.  Annoyingly, I found another outrigger that is totally and utterly knackered.  That makes two which need replacing and I only have spare parts for one.  Also, this one is under the cab, so will be a right pain to get to. 

You may ask how I failed to notice such a thing and the fact is that I didn't.  It was actually the first bit of rust I noticed when we picked The Duke up from <span>Witham</span>, but time had erased my memory of this tragic moment and I'd totally forgotten about it.

So, tomorrow will be a day of grinding and welding.  Joy!
