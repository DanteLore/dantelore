I got up early today - on a Saturday - to get a full day working on The Duke.  I've finished now, with seven hours of hard work done, a slight sunburn and a big smile on my face!  After a long soak in the bath I'm going to hit the beers and celebrate.

"Celebrate what?" I hear you cry.  Well, today I ticked off a fair few things from last week's To-Do list and I drove The Duke backwards and forwards a bit, which always makes me happy!

First off, I got the pressure washer out - kindly lent to us by Lorna's boss - and cleaned off the drive, the chassis and the underside of the tub.  With a nice clean surface to paint (decided to leave any old covering which withstood the <span>Karcher</span>) I could whack a thick coat of <span>underseal</span> on and get it looking smart.  Well, smart for the underside of a twenty year old car anyway!

All this good news obviously needs to be tempered with a bit of bad - and there was some bad news today.  Annoyingly, I found another outrigger that is totally and utterly knackered.  That makes two which need replacing and I only have spare parts for one.  Also, this one is under the cab, so will be a right pain to get to. 

You may ask how I failed to notice such a thing and the fact is that I didn't.  It was actually the first bit of rust I noticed when we picked The Duke up from <span>Witham</span>, but time had erased my memory of this tragic moment and I'd totally forgotten about it.

So, tomorrow will be a day of grinding and welding.  Joy!
