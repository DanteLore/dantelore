OK, Johnson shouted at me all day for wanting to chop out all the military lighting <span>gubbins</span>.  However, I wasn't really up for spending over £250 on replacement parts.

I think I've come up with a general plan:
<ul><li>Bypass the IR relay and leave the IR switch disconnected for now.  No driving along without lights, and no disaster if a relay fails!</li><li>Disconnect the convoy lamp for now, with a view to adding a switch for it later!
</li><li>Use the civilian 2-way light switch to replace the 6-way military one (I need two modes, not six: side lights or head lights).</li><li>Bypass the Auxiliary relay, which is not needed if you don't want to run without lights.
</li><li>Isolate the big current flow using a relay (or two) instead of wiring through the lighting switch directly.</li><li>Replace the broken dash <span>illumination</span> switch.
</li><li>Leave the fog lights as they are, but get a replacement switch and new fog relay.</li><li>Get a cheap replacement flasher (with bulb failure warning).</li><li>Blank off the military panel and use blanking plate as a place to mount <span style="font-style: italic;">spare</span> warning lamps, <span>gauges</span> and so on.
</li></ul>All in all, including connectors, cable, relays, switches, flasher and so on, I think this should cost about £100.  Extra lights and gauges will be just that.  Not exactly cheap, but a good three-way compromise between original features, simplicity and safety!
