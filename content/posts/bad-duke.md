As a software developer, I'm used to things working fine 'til you show them to somebody else.  Computers know when there's a senior bod from your biggest customer watching and do their best to screw things up.  Seems that Land Rovers are the same!

Dad popped round yesterday morning - I had to day off to go canooing on the Thames - and I gave him a guided tour of my pet project.  "It starts first time" I told him, when attaching the battery.  Starts first time?  Yeah, right!  The Duke, who'd started first go only the day before, was not having any of it.  Back to the old not-turning-over issues I've had before. 

The batteries are on charge now, and I'll see if he plays ball again tomorrow, but that won't change the fact that I looked like a right plonker yesterday!  Lucky it was only the Father!
