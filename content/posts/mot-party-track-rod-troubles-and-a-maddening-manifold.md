Lots to report today - some good, some bad as usual!  Not posted much on the blog for a while as I've been doing jobs that are too boring to bother talking about.  Fixing the driver's door, spending Â£23 on new headlight adjuster screws, fixing the brake light switch and cleaning out the interior are not particularly exciting, so I did them without taking any photos.

The excitement returned last night when Jason and Dr Johnson came round to perform an unofficial MOT test for me.  Since they were the pair who helped me drag The Duke's rusting hulk down to Reading, it seemed only right that they be the ones to give him his first seal of approval... or not, as it turned out.  Lorna prepared a reward for them in the form of The World's Greatest Shepherd's Pie.

Jason did the paperwork while Dr J ran round like a maniac, poking, prodding and probing round every nook and cranny he could find.  We jacked up all four wheels and ran the engine in gear to free-up the brakes, poked around the chassis with screwdrivers, examined the body for sharp edges and wobbly bits and ran the usual lighting checks.  All this was based on the official MOT procedure which I printed out from [<img src="http://danandtheduke.co.uk/uploaded_images/IMG_1983-750654.JPG"/>](http://danandtheduke.co.uk/uploaded_images/IMG_1983-750724.JPG)
Should have read the manual to get instructions on how to remove the track rod - turns out you twist it off the two bolts at each end (which have opposite threads to allow this).  I spent far too long bashing with the hammer before I realised how it works.

So, as I said earlier, some good news and far too much bad news.  A good few days of hard work needed to get the exhaust manifold replaced and a few more odd jobs to do round the body before The Duke and me head to the MOT centre!
