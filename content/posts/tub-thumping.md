Ron popped round this evening and helped lift the tub on.  I have a Land Rover shaped Land Rover again!  Woo!

Much bashing, hammering and smacking was required, but we got there in the end.  Pints have been credited to Ron's account.

In the end I worked til 9:30 and didn't even have anything to eat until 10:30!  To be honest, after a full weekend and two nights of full-on Duking, I'm ready for a night off.

It's all been worth it though - a few bolts left to do up and I can bung the roof on!  The roof!  Holy smoke!  Expect more information this weekend.
