The leaf springs on the back of The Duke are rusty as hell, but seem to be in good condition otherwise.  They need some serious TLC.

<a href="http://www.lrseries.com/shop/product/listing/17265/DC7104-BLACK-POLYURETHANE-BUSH-KIT-SERIES-3-LWB.html">polyeurethane</a> are best), a polishing wheel for the grinder and maybe some Denso tape too (apparently it's also useful for protecting nuts from corrosion).

I also want to replace the shocks.  It's possible that they're fine, but they are very rusty on the outside and don't cost much to renew.
