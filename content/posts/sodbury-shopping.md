This Sunday, Doctor Johnson and myself drove down to <span>Beaulieu</span> for the <span>Sodbury</span> <span>Sortout</span>.  It used to be a lot closer, on the <span>Newbury</span> Showground, but it wasn't a terrible journey down to the New Forest.

It was a rainy day and I think this worked in our favour.  We spent just over £300 between us, and £250 of that went on The Duke.  The weather kept the crowds away, so there was plenty of scope for a bargain, especially in the closing moments as the stall holders started to pack away.

At least in the strictest sense of the word.  I managed to get this generator, starter and ignition system for £60.  I'd originally asked about the generator because of my problems with the charge warning light, but couldn't resist buying the lot.

They're second hand, but I think there's enough tread on them to last me a couple of thousand miles - which will take some time in The Duke!  £50 for the lot.

It was £12.50 for the light and £8 for the two fog light lenses.

Don't think I was ripped off.

All in all a very nice day, though I was knackered by the time I got home.
