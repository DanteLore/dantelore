I've always harboured a desire to do practical and manly things with my spare time instead of sitting on the sofa playing on the <span>Xbox</span>.  When my good friend Doctor Johnson splashed out on a thirty-year-old Land Rover Country Station Waggon a couple of years ago I was inspired.  Helping out with maintenance tasks (i.e. chopping bits off with an angle grinder) was great fun and at the end of a hard day's work you have something real to be proud of - much better than writing software!

So a couple of months ago I ended up placing a bid in a [<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62oTnOHwOSo/SUrAdsasm4I/AAAAAAAAAAs/dYTscGACtrM/s200/IMG_4242.JPG"/>](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62oTnOHwOSo/SUrAdsasm4I/AAAAAAAAAAs/dYTscGACtrM/s1600-h/IMG_4242.JPG)it.  The <span>Terrano</span> dropped down to 35 miles per hour on one section of the M25 and the diesel cost £75 but all the way home I stared out of the back window and grinned at the big green thing.  Thank the Lord that the steering, hand brake, clutch and gears all worked; we used them all to get it into the drive.  Thanks also to the random man who helped push.  Would he have helped push a broken transit van?  Is there some innate property of a knackered British vehicle that makes people care?  Probably not, but he helped anyway.

So there you go.  I now own a Land Rover.  It's big, it's green, it can start a Lynx helicopter and will cost £1500 to get up and running but I don't care what you think; it's the best thing I've played with since my <span>Lego</span> got locked in the cellar.
