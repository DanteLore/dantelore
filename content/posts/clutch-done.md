Two more days of work on this and the new clutch is finally in!  Fitting the gearbox is not really a one man job.  By the end of yesterday, with the light fading, I still had a list of jobs as long as my arm to complete.  Coupled with a nasty cold, this left me rather <span>despondent</span>.  Today was a new day though and with the sun beaming down from on high, the Gods of the Land Rover smiled upon the project and everything was done within three hours.

Just been out for a test drive round a muddy byway just South of the M4.  Works well in two and four wheel drive and it felt great to be out and about on such a beautiful day.

<span><span>Speedo</span></span> is still knackered and there hasn't been much of a change in top speed.  Still, <span>mustn't</span> grumble...
