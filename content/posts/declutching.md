Here's some pictures from the last couple of evenings, over which I've stripped off the clutch master and slave cylinders for replacement. They both came off really easily, especially the slave which benefited from being in the under-engine oil bath present on most Land Rovers!

There's another underneath though, so the pedal had to come off.</span>

The bolts go through the bulkhead into captive nuts, which makes removing them very simple.</span>

The nuts on the shaft, where it attaches to the pedal, are slightly hard to undo.  In the end I grabbed the shaft with mole grips to stop it spinning.</span>

First job was to undo the bleed nipple.</span>

The inside of the slave looks a bit on the grotty side, but I have to say there were no signs of any leaks.

Next job is to order some replacements and get them fitted and working.
