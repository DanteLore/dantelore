Here's some pictures from the last couple of evenings, over which I've stripped off the clutch master and slave cylinders for replacement. They both came off really easily, especially the slave which benefited from being in the under-engine oil bath present on most Land Rovers!

The inside of the slave looks a bit on the grotty side, but I have to say there were no signs of any leaks.

Next job is to order some replacements and get them fitted and working.
