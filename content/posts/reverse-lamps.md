Just a quick point of interest:  Civilian Series III Land Rovers don't have reverse lamps!

I spent a few hours last night comparing the military circuit diagram to the civilian one in the Haynes manual.  Managed to combine the two to make a plan for wiring The Duke.  It was mainly an exercise in deletion; most of the switches and relays in the military system are not needed, in fact no relays are needed at all.  I guess I'll leave them hanging about behind the dashboard, disconnected.

I buzzed out the new dash with a multimeter too.  Everything seems OK except the dashboard illumination switch, which is broken.  It's about a fiver for a new one (eBay), but I'm not sure what the point of turning the dashboard lights on and off <span>independently</span> is, so I may just link them in with the head/side lights.

The only unknown left with the electrics is the flasher relay, which I need to investigate next.  The civilian one has two pins, a constant voltage input and a pulsing output, as you might expect.  The military one has six pins and is connected to several relays and switches.  If I can replicate the civilian behaviour with the military part I'll be very happy!

Have ordered some 24v bulbs from <a href="http://www.lrseries.com/">L R Series</a> to finish their Christmas holidays so I can get hold of a new ignition switch, indicator stalk and some other 24v bulbs.  Once I have all those I can get out in the cold and start wiring!

The last thing on the shopping list for the electrics is a pair of batteries (not attaching radio batteries just yet).  Along with the <a href="http://www.royalsignals.org.uk/MOD%20batteries/009/01000207.pdf">two huge radio batteries</a>, there were three batteries in The Duke when we picked it up - an 063, 065 and an 071.  Not sure which I need, but the cheaper the better!
