Just a quick point of interest:  Civilian Series III Land Rovers don't have reverse lamps!

I spent a few hours last night comparing the military circuit diagram to the civilian one in the Haynes manual.  Managed to combine the two to make a plan for wiring The Duke.  It was mainly an exercise in deletion; most of the switches and relays in the military system are not needed, in fact no relays are needed at all.  I guess I'll leave them hanging about behind the dashboard, disconnected.

<a href="http://www.royalsignals.org.uk/MOD%20batteries/009/01000207.pdf">two huge radio batteries</a>, there were three batteries in The Duke when we picked it up - an 063, 065 and an 071.  Not sure which I need, but the cheaper the better!
