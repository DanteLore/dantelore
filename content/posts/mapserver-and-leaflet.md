## Leaflet
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) is a very simple but incredibly powerful Javascript mapping library that lets you add interactive maps to your website very easily.  Try scrolling and zooming around this one:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet-0.7.3/leaflet.css" />
<script src="http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet-0.7.3/leaflet.js"></script><script>// <![CDATA[
var map = L.map('danMap').setView([51.4, -1.25], 13);	
L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/genious.igfmnea7/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', 
{
  attribution: 'Map data &copy; [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com)',
  maxZoom: 18,
}).addTo(map);
// ]]></script>

For example, to add that map to this page, all I did was add the following code (after reading the [Quick-Start Guide](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html)):

[sourcecode language="html"]
&lt;div id=&quot;danMap&quot; style=&quot;height: 200px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet-0.7.3/leaflet.css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet-0.7.3/leaflet.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
var map = L.map('danMap').setView([51.4, -1.25], 13);	
L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/YOUR.MAP.KEY/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', 
{
  attribution: 'Map data &amp;copy; &lt;a href=&quot;http://openstreetmap.org&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; contributors, &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;CC-BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;, Imagery Â© &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapbox.com&quot;&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt;',
  maxZoom: 18,
}).addTo(map);
&lt;/script&gt;
[/sourcecode]

You can add points, polygons and visualise all kinds of live data using a simple web service that returns some [GeoJson](http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson.html) data. It works like a charm on mobile devices too!

## Why combine Leaflet with Mapserver?
I have a couple of use-cases that meant I needed to look at combining Leaflet with Mapserver. This turns out to be easy enough as Leaflet can hook up to any tile provider and Mapserver can be set up to serve images as a [Web Map Service (WMS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service).

The first thing I wanted to do is serve up some map data when not connected to the internet. Imagine I am in the middle of nowhere, connected to the Raspberry Pi in the back of the Land Rover via WiFi to my phone or tablet. I have a GPS signal but I don't have any connection to a map imagery server as there's no mobile coverage. I need to use mapserver to render some local map data so I can see where I am. This use case has a boring work-related benefit too - it enables you to serve up maps in a web-based mapping application behind a strict corporate firewall.

The other use case is simple: raster data. Lots of the data we deal with where I work is served up as raster data by Mapserver. Imagine it as heat-maps of some KPI value layered on top of a street map.

## Setting up Mapserver
There are a couple of things you need to do to [EPSG 3857](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/epsg3857/).  Make sure you use that EPSG at the root of your map file.

[sourcecode]
PROJECTION
  &quot;init=epsg:3857&quot;
END
	
WEB
  METADATA
    &quot;wms_title&quot; &quot;Dans Layers and Stuff&quot;
    &quot;wms_onlineresource&quot; &quot;http://192.168.2.164/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?&quot;
    &quot;wms_enable_request&quot; &quot;*&quot;
    &quot;wms_srs&quot; &quot;EPSG:3857&quot;
    &quot;wms_feature_info_mime_type&quot; &quot;text/html&quot;
    &quot;wms_format&quot; &quot;image/png&quot;
  END
END[/sourcecode]

The next thing to do is add some extra stuff to every layer in your map.  You need to set the STATUS field to 'on'; add a METADATA element and set the 'wms_title' to something sensible; and finally add a projection, specifying the projection the layer data is stored in.  As I am using the [OS VectorMap District dataset](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/vectormap-district.html), which is on the OSGB projection I used EPSG 27700.

[sourcecode]
LAYER
  NAME         Woodland
  DATA         Woodland
  PROJECTION
    &quot;init=epsg:27700&quot;
  END
  METADATA
    &quot;wms_title&quot; &quot;Woodland&quot;
  END
  STATUS       on
  TYPE         POLYGON
  CLASS	
    STYLE
      COLOR 20 40 20
    END
  END
END 
[/sourcecode]

## Connecting it Together
You can then add a new layer to the Leaflet map, connected to your Mapserver.  Here I'm using ms4w, the Windows version of Mapserver and hooking it up to a map file in my Dropbox folder.  The map file I am using is the one I created for a [previous post on mapserver](http://logicalgenetics.com/mapserver-revisited/).

[sourcecode language="javascript"]
L.tileLayer.wms(&quot;http://localhost:8001/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=D:\\Dropbox\\Data\\Mapfiles\\leaflet.map&quot;, {
			layers: 'Roads,MotorwayJunctions',
			format: 'image/png',
			transparent: true,
			attribution: &quot;Dan's Amazing Roads&quot;,
			maxZoom: 18,
			minZoom: 12,
		}).addTo(map);
[/sourcecode]

Sadly I don't have a mapserver instance on the internet, so all I can show here is a couple of screenshots.  You'll just have to take my word for it - it works brilliantly!
