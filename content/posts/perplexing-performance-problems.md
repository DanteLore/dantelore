As I mentioned in earlier posts, I had some trouble with a loss of power when jumping quickly onto the gas - the engine would just stall.  The only way round it was to come right off the gas and onto the clutch before the engine completely cut out.  Slowly pressing the pedal was fine - it was only a problem when I pressed too fast.

In the Zenith <span>carb</span> that I have, there is a small piston which squirts a shot of fuel into the throat of the <span>carb</span> when the throttle is operated.  Normally, fuel is "sucked" into the engine by the vacuum in the inlet manifold - the higher the revs, the lower the pressure, the more fuel is sucked into the engine (regulated by the throttle setting).  When you jump on the gas the engine is not <span>revving</span> fast, so there isn't enough vacuum to suck in enough fuel to get it started.  Thus the extra little squirt mechanism, which gives a quick boost.

Sure enough, I found that I wasn't getting any little squirt when I pressed the throttle.  So the <span>carb</span> had to be opened up.  Not as complicated a job as I'd thought, but a very stinky one!

At the bottom of the piston is a ball bearing valve which ensures that petrol is pumped into the engine rather than just squirting back into the <span>carb</span> reservoir.  You can see that the ball has jumped out of the hole and got stuck.

So I fixed the problem and got the engine up and running again.  Things are slightly better... BUT... I can still stall the engine by jumping on the gas.  Very odd.  More investigation needed.
