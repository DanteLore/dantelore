I haven't finished yet, but this leaf spring refurbishment job is taking a very very long time.  One spring is more or less done - pending a good coat of <span><span>Hammerite</span></span>.  Split the other one <span>apart</span> tonight, though it will take at least another week to get it finished.  Then there's the front ones to worry about!

Here are some photos.  Taken over a period of many days they document a long and drawn out labour of love!

Not sure it'll stick because <span>everything's</span> covered in a thin layer grease, but I <span>wiped</span> it and gave it a try anyway!</span>
