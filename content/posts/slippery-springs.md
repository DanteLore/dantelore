I haven't finished yet, but this leaf spring refurbishment job is taking a very very long time.  One spring is more or less done - pending a good coat of <span><span>Hammerite</span></span>.  Split the other one <span>apart</span> tonight, though it will take at least another week to get it finished.  Then there's the front ones to worry about!

Here are some photos.  Taken over a period of many days they document a long and drawn out labour of love!

Every nut and bolt needed replacing and the surfaces were covered with surface rust.  There are also patches of <span><span>underseal</span></span> on the outer edges, which ruin sandpaper, making it quite challenging to get them cleaned up.

They look quite nice now they're done.  They took three coats of <span><span>Hammerite</span></span> each!</span>

Earlier tonight I greased the leaves with <span><span>Lith</span></span>-<span><span>Moly</span></span> grease (which chemically bonds to the metal, thus resisting displacement by water) and bolted it all back together.  The centre bolt is temporary, pending the arrival of the real thing.  I used 100mm M8 bolts for the bindings as they are much cheaper than the real deal.</span>

Not sure it'll stick because <span>everything's</span> covered in a thin layer grease, but I <span>wiped</span> it and gave it a try anyway!</span>
