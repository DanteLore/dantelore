I've said this before and I'm sure I'll probably say it again: <span style="font-weight: bold;"> All the welding is now finished!</span>  Not much to say about it really.  <span>Wasn't</span> the simplest bit of welding, but I managed it in the end.

Luckily I had a bit that was almost exactly the right size, so I didn't need to do much cutting.  It's very handy that Series Land Rovers come with a metalwork bench bolted to the front - the bumper!</span>

Proof that The Duke is not a ringer!
