It was raining a little today, so I slobbed on the sofa for a couple of hours before I decided I really should still attempt to get The Duke's clutch fixed.  It's better to regret something you <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> done, after all.So, this post is a guide to how I dropped the gearbox, clutch, flywheel and flywheel housing off, ready to to fix the clutch and a suspect crankshaft oil seal.  Note that because The Duke is a newer model he has a removable gearbox crossmember, so I didn't need to take the seat box off.

Full of a nasty sludge of clutch dust and leaked engine oil.</span><span style="font-size:85%;">
</span>Just getting all that to bits took five hours of constant work.  I have cut my hands to ribbons, got rust and oil in my eyes and not a single new part has been attached yet!  Watch this space for chapter two...
