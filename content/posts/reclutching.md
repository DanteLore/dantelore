Fitting and bleeding the clutch couldn't have been easier!  Just hope it doesn't leak and make me look stupid!  Lorna gave a hand (or a foot) with the bleeding process.  Luckily, her dad has press ganged her into helping to bleed his brakes for the last 20-odd years, so she's a seasoned professional!

Ran a good quantity of fluid through the pipes to flush the system and then bled it properly.  Started the engine and got into gear no problem, so getting off the ramps was much easier than getting on!
