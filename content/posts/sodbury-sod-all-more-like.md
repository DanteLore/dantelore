It's Sodbury day again!  Dr Johnson and I headed down there in The Duke as usual.  Though this year is the first in which both The Duke and Plum are on the road we couldn't afford the fuel costs of a convoy!

The sortout this year was probably the worst one yet.  We had our first hint that it might not be up to much when we counted only two series 'drovers in the car park.  When we got to the field itself, we found it full of overpriced Disco-Bling and equally expensive, non-Land Rover-specific, surplus tat.

It's probably a good thing that this year we didn't have much of a shopping list.  Dr J was after some tyres, which proved fruitless.  Last year just about every stall had one or two stacks of rubber doughnuts going for bargain prices; this year you'd be disappointed unless you were after mega-aggressive mud-pluggers for £200 a pop. Lots of the other stalls were selling tools, equipment, surplus bits and bobs.  I almost dropped a reasonable sum on a beefy air compressor, but bottled it in the end.

Sodbury is just a small part of the auto-jumble though, so there's plenty more to look at.  I was quite overwhelmed by a stall selling just about every type of aluminium bar stock available.  Their prices seemed pretty good so I picked up a few chunks for about £30.

I also got a chunk of exhaust pipe to chop up for the 200 TDi project and a 2 ton chain hoist (for a very reasonable £25).  Dr J picked up a bag of ratchet straps and a money box.
