This is more of a utility post than something that anyone is going to find massively interesting.  Hopefully you'll like the pictures though.

Now I have a plan to do some more major work on The Duke I am feeling much more motivated to get stuff done.  The overdrive is crying out for a gearbox to be bolted to, so this evening I unpacked all the bits I carefully put away last summer and started to check them out. Eventually I'll have a list of everything I need to rebuild the box.

Have the day off tomorrow, so watch this space for more photos!
