Just a quick post to say I'm almost finished with the rear lights.  The fuse box works well and looks reasonably smart mounted in the engine compartment.

Also mounted the headlight relays behind the air filter.  The tips of the self-tappers can be seen through the grille, so maybe should replace with nuts and bolts.  Will do for now though!
