Feeling very optimistic tonight so I thought I'd share the joy on the blog!

Took the first set of wheels and tyres to ATS today to get them <span>transferred</span> over.  Was <span style="font-style: italic;">slightly</span> depressed when they told me I needed tubes too.  Bumped the price up to about £30 per wheel; £150 in total.  The other two wheels go in tomorrow, so I have to spend another three hours of my life in the nightmare traffic of Berkshire's county town.

Worth the hassle and expense though - I picked the wheels up tonight and feel much better about it.  They look very smart and the Avon <span><span>Rangemasters</span></span> are nobly enough not to make The Duke look like a wussy road car!  Amusingly they've attempted to balance them too, assuming I suppose, that they'll be fitted to a car that can hit speeds over 20MPH.  Each wheel has between six and eight of the biggest balancing weights I've ever seen and I'd be willing to bet they're still wobbly!

This evening I spent a couple of hours on the floodlit drive swapping the wheels over and fiddling with other <span><span>pre</span></span>-MOT jobs.  Got the <span><span>bumperettes</span></span> bolted onto the new <span><span>crossmember</span></span> with some bolts from eBay: M8 x 80mm A2 stainless bolts in fact, coming in at 75p each!  The middle step is the only problem - I've lost the adapter that can be seen under the lifting ring in the following photo, so need to dig it out or replace it with a home-made one.
