It's not snowy or rainy at the moment, so I decided to get up extra early this morning (well, 8am) to get a few hours done on The Duke before we go to a wedding later on today.

The temperature probe on my new multimeter gave a reading of -4 degrees.  Cold!

I would have finished the job today - maybe Lorna could even have been bribed to come out and help me do some bleeding - but on the last cylinder (rear left) the bloody nut sheared and I had to saw off the brake pipe.  So now I need to get yet more stuff sent through the post before I have working brakes.

I spent well over Â£100 on new parts for the brakes.  Have heard quite a few damning reports on the replacement cylinders that are available so spent about four times as much on "genuine" Lucas replacements.  I think the brakes are the one part of the project where spending a bit more is a sensible idea!

So, the new pipe will be ordered tomorrow and hopefully fitted next weekend.  Then I just need to start on the welding and I'm ready for MOT take two.
