It's not snowy or rainy at the moment, so I decided to get up extra early this morning (well, 8am) to get a few hours done on The Duke before we go to a wedding later on today.

So, the new pipe will be ordered tomorrow and hopefully fitted next weekend.  Then I just need to start on the welding and I'm ready for MOT take two.
