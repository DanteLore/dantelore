I just completed my second ever air engine: The Chuffer.  With this project I decided that I'd go for complexity, rather than the simplistic approach I took when I built [The Wobbler](http://logicalgenetics.com/the-wobbler/) earlier this year.

The Chuffer is a twin-cylinder double acting engine - which means each of its two cylinders both push *and* pull the piston.  This means it operates much more smoothly and can self-start as there's always a piston on a power stroke, regardless of where the flywheel is.

Unlike its predecessor, the Chuffer has fixed cylinders and airflow is controlled by two [spool valves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAHVn4lawnw), operated by eccentrics next to the flywheel via some pushrods and a hopelessly over-engineered lever mechanism.

And of course everything was made by yours truly, in the garage, from chunks of brass, steel and aluminium bar and flat stock I bought on eBay.  Needless to say, I have learned a lot since I started the project this February!

What's next?  Well, maybe a [generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator)...
