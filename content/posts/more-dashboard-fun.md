Got a new attachment for my <span>Dremel</span> on my way home today.  This allowed me to bodge some extra holes in the centre dash panel for the hazard switch and main lighting switch (the hole for which was too small).  Not massively proud of the results - I kept slipping!  Still, it won't look out of place when installed.
