My six-way light switch is a bit dodgy. It works, but when you move it to a new position you have to twiddle it about a bit to make a good contact. The lights flicker when you do this wiggling and there's no way that it's going to pass an MOT like that.

I got the switch off eBay, so I guess I could go the whole "bad feedback" route, maybe try for my money back. Then again, the guy sold it to me "as seen" and didn't make any promises about it. After all, it does work... <span style="font-style: italic;">mostly</span>.

So, I decided to have a look inside tonight.  Here are some pictures.  Can't find any pictures on the web, so I've done a few in the hopes that they might help other people.
