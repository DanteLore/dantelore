Got up early again today to do a bit more on The Duke before Lorna crawled out of bed.  Along with some work yesterday, I've managed to make some good progress.

Firstly, thanks to the Lovely Lorna for some more excellent pedal pumping.  Bled the brakes through reasonably <span>successfully</span>, though there was a touch of foaminess to the fluid, so they may need doing again before The Duke goes back on the road.  Instead of buying a replacement pipe for the back I actually made one.  Got all the tools and fittings I need to replace just about every pipe on the Land Rover for Â£90.  Christmas money well spent and brakes more or less done!

I also spent some time yesterday taking off the front suspension.  I worked out that it would be easier to patch the front <span>dumbiron</span> without the spring on, so decided to take the lot off and refurbish both springs as I did at the back.

So, that's a couple of niggles sorted and some prep done for the big welding jobs.  Other than the welding, all I need to do now is get some new spark plugs to get it firing on all four cylinders again, split and grease the springs and refit the front suspension.  Just hope the weather warms up a bit!
