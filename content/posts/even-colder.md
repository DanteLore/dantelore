Got up early again today to do a bit more on The Duke before Lorna crawled out of bed.  Along with some work yesterday, I've managed to make some good progress.

Firstly, thanks to the Lovely Lorna for some more excellent pedal pumping.  Bled the brakes through reasonably <span>successfully</span>, though there was a touch of foaminess to the fluid, so they may need doing again before The Duke goes back on the road.  Instead of buying a replacement pipe for the back I actually made one.  Got all the tools and fittings I need to replace just about every pipe on the Land Rover for Â£90.  Christmas money well spent and brakes more or less done!

I also spent some time yesterday taking off the front suspension.  I worked out that it would be easier to patch the front <span>dumbiron</span> without the spring on, so decided to take the lot off and refurbish both springs as I did at the back.

Today, after sweeping away a <span>layer</span> of ice crystals from the drive, I dropped the fuel tanks off so I can get access to the outriggers that need replacing.  While they were off I replaced the cracked cork seals with the new rubber ones I ordered a few weeks back.

While I was lying on the frozen tarmac I happened to find the other end of the <span>speedo</span> cable (haven't looked that hard in the past!) so I decided to swap that out while I was at it.  What an annoying job!

In the end I lost one of the screws while trying to <span>attach</span> the new cable.  Not sure how terrible this is really.  Might just forget about it!

In a terrible breech of health and safety regulations, I tested the <span>speedo</span> by jacking up a rear wheel, starting the engine and bunging it in gear.  It works!

So, that's a couple of niggles sorted and some prep done for the big welding jobs.  Other than the welding, all I need to do now is get some new spark plugs to get it firing on all four cylinders again, split and grease the springs and refit the front suspension.  Just hope the weather warms up a bit!
