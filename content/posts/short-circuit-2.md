Found the cause of the short in the tail lights today.  The connection for the number plate lamp wasn't insulated properly and was touching the floor of the <span>cubby</span> box.  The damage that had been done was pretty shocking - behind the dash the wire just got hot, but towards the back the insulation was totally burned away.
