I only meant to spend an hour or so out on the drive today, but I ended up out there and working hard for about five hours.  Finished off my wooden <span>crossmember</span> jig and put the rear chassis on <span>axle</span> stands to keep it still.  In order to keep the chassis still I had to drop the rear leaf springs off, which was hard work.  Finally, just before it got dark, I got the grinder out and chopped the rear <span>crossmember</span> off.

I think I'll use the top one!  Need to <span>detach</span> the steps, convoy light and trailer socket from the old one, then bung it in the bin.  Two grinding wheels and a knackered hacksaw blade are included in the photo so set the tone.

The Duke's looking quite sad at the moment.  No roof, no tub, chopped up chassis - more bits missing than replaced.  Hopefully this will be the lowest point of the project.  From now on things should start getting refurbished, replaced and reinstalled.
