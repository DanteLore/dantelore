This week I decided to drop the voltage for the gauges down to 12v. Buying all the 24v stuff is expensive and since I got some gauges with the new dash, I've got some of the stuff already.  My mind was further made up when I found that the 30+ year old 24v fuel gauge I bought a few weeks ago was knackered.  So I sent that back, ordered some 12v fuel senders (£25 or so) and have got my hands on a 24v-12v dropper via the land rover forums (£10ish).

Today I decided to bung the new fuel senders in, ready to wire up all the gauges when the voltage dropper arrives.  The passenger side sender was a doddle: lift the seat up, unscrew the sender and bung the new one in.  The drivers side was not so easy: the sender is underneath the seat frame, which would be a real pain to remove.

Luckily, I found that the tank is held on by just four bolts, three at the front and one big one at the back.  Dropping the tank off turned out to be quite a useful exercise, as I could get to the tank hangers and chassis and scrape off half of Salisbury plain, which was stuck in there.  Need to get some underseal on there, but otherwise it looks OK.
