This week I decided to drop the voltage for the gauges down to 12v. Buying all the 24v stuff is expensive and since I got some gauges with the new dash, I've got some of the stuff already.  My mind was further made up when I found that the 30+ year old 24v fuel gauge I bought a few weeks ago was knackered.  So I sent that back, ordered some 12v fuel senders (£25 or so) and have got my hands on a 24v-12v dropper via the land rover forums (£10ish).

Today I decided to bung the new fuel senders in, ready to wire up all the gauges when the voltage dropper arrives.  The passenger side sender was a doddle: lift the seat up, unscrew the sender and bung the new one in.  The drivers side was not so easy: the sender is underneath the seat frame, which would be a real pain to remove.
