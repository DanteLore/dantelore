Went out today to enjoy the couple of hours of sunshine that occurred before it rained.  Since the project overall is held up by a lack of funds, I was planning to tinker with the helicopter starting circuit to see how it works, but instead I finished off the last of the important electrical jobs - getting the brake lights working and sorting out the horn.  Sadly, no photos today.

The horn turned out to be very simple indeed - there is a strange brown wire, terminated with a female spade connector, which comes out of the civilian indicator stalk loom.  This turned out to be the horn supply.  So wiring it up was dead easy.  Let it be known that The Duke has quite a hoot on him!

The brake switch was another case for Lorna's amazing silver polish.  After sorting out some very poor connections in the fuse box under the steering column, I extracted the brake switch to find it totally corroded and ceased.  I had to smack it quite hard on the bumper to even get it to move.  To my surprise, two minutes in the polish-pot and a swish round in soapy water and it was good as new!  Didn't take long to get that back in and adjusted, making me almost-electrically-road-legal.

Only other thing to note today is that I suspect that the air hose I bought is too short and that the <a href="http://www.lrseries.com/shop/product/listing/776/347322-WINDOW-CATCH-ASSEMBLY.html">window catches</a> I got from LR Series are absolutely and totally crap!  The bolt is plastic and the assembly doesn't even fit properly into the hole in the door tops.  Do not buy them!

There won't be much more news before pay-day, as I need to spend another Â£250 on engine parts before The Duke can continue to take shape.
