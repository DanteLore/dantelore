Spent today detaching the tub from the chassis and my fingernail from my finger.  Probably less than thirty bolts in all but it took me a whole day and drove to despair more than once.  As I type, with a newly blackened fingernail, the tub is still on - I need to remove all the cabling and enlist some assistants - but most of the bolts are undone and it's just about ready to lift off.

The nuts and bolts were hard to reach, badly rusted and seized or <span>buried</span> in <span>under seal</span> and mud. Thanks to Land Rover's design engineers and the MOD all the ones I needed to drill or grind were made of hardened stainless steel, while all the ones I could do with a socket and spanner were made of pig iron.
