Found the places where I need to get busy with the MIG for the MOT.  Here are some pictures...

This is the big one - the underside of the front spring hanger on the driver's side.  Lord only knows how I didn't spot it.  It'll need quite a big patch and will involve some upside down welding.

Patching the spring hanger will do the job, but the outriggers will be a real pain to get to with the welder.  I am actually considering replacing them, as grinding them off and welding on new ones would mean less of the body being removed for access.  Only problem is that I can't find replacement parts!
