Following on from the work on the transfer case, this evening's task was to get the main gearbox to bits.  I was pleased to find that it's a newer fully <span>synchromeshed</span> version, which means it'll be a drop-in replacement for my current box where double clutching is an option rather than a necessity.

This can only be replaced by heating the gearbox casing and drifting out the shaft.  Not in any way an easy job.

The guy who sold me the gearbox at <span>Sodbury</span> claimed to have refurbished it not long before his Land Rover was killed off by a rusty chassis.  I suspect that the reverse gear was just too much of a pain to replace when he did the job.
