Popped to Halfords yesterday to get some axle stands, a four ton bottle jack and an 18 inch breaker bar.  This allowed me and Jay to get the front wheels off and investigate the brakes and drive train.

A mixture of good and bad news again.  I'm starting to think that everything on the 'drover is broken!

Hopefully I have enough to finish the electrics and get the doors and locks fixed too. Then I'll start saving up for engine bits!
