Yesterday I started fitting the new rear <span>crossmember</span> and cleaning off the chassis for welding.  I did the whole thing wearing my new safety glasses.  The fan from the drill managed to waft something up under the glasses and into my right eye.  I didn't think much of it at first but it got worse and worse through the day.

<span>Annoyingly</span>, I'd promised to take Lorna out for some drinks and a posh meal in the evening and being an old romantic, I didn't want to cancel.  I tried washing my eyes out, rubbing, poking and eye drops but nothing made it any better.  Eight hours after the event, sat in our favourite restaurant enjoying some fantastic food, we decided to skip desert and head to casualty.

A&E on a Saturday night was as lovely as ever.  The doctors didn't laugh at me and employed all sorts of high tech gadgetry to remove a massive boulder (OK, it was barely visible) from my eye.  I felt much better til the anesthetic wore off!
