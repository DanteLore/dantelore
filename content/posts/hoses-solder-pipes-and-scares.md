On Easter Monday I did a bit more tinkering in the engine compartment.  Fitted the air intake hose and new washer pump, sorted out the heater motor resistor and replaced a leaky water hose.  I'd hoped to do some debugging on the charge warning light too, but a strange problem put an early end to my day...

Worked through the entire list and found nothing wrong.  Not a sausage.  Then I found I could turn the fan by hand if I really heaved.  A few minutes later it had loosened up nicely.  I turned it over with the starter without the plugs in for a while, then bunged them back and fired it up...

...and it worked!  Excellent news.  But the real cause of the problem remains a mystery...
