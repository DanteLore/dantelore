The first bit of good news is that the starter motor works and the engine turns over.  The fuel pump works too, sending petrol flying all over the shop (added a fire extinguisher to the shopping list!).  The borrowed and resurrected batteries didn't seem to mind doing the job either - voltage dropped by about 4v while cranking but recovered afterwards.

Fitted the new indicator stalk and ignition switch without problems - though I had to file one side of the ignition switch flat to fit it in.  The plug connector for the indicators fits into the military socket in the dash (wire colours all match, which is a good sign!).  The military stalk has another connector for the other wires, but the replacement part does not.  Haven't yet worked out what to do about this.

The rest of the military electrics have been pillaged pretty badly.  Only two relays remain and they are the least useful - the <span style="font-style: italic;">service brake relay</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">auxiliary relay</span>.  Both wired up properly and at least one of them clicks when the electrics are turned on, but I doubt I'll use either of them.  The 6-way light switch, hazard switch and flasher unit are all gone and would cost a bloody fortune to replace:

Doubt either of them will be used for their intended purpose when I'm done!</span>
