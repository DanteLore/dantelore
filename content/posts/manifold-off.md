Before I spent Â£100 on new bits to replace the cracked exhaust manifold I thought I'd play it safe and whip the old one off to see what bits and bobs I needed.  "Whip it off" indeed!  Turned out to be a bit harder than that.  Very messy, very hard work and I ended up having to wash my hair in <span>Swarfega</span> after dunking it in a little puddle The Duke had left to say thank you for his oil change.

So, I now have an idea what new bits I need and can start getting things ordered.  Hopefully the engine will be running again within two weeks and I'll be back on track for the MOT.
