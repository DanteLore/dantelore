Well, I haven't posted for quite a while, but that doesn't mean that I haven't been busy.  Since my last post quite a bit has changed.  Not least among the changes being the fact that I am now a married man.  Also, in a week's time we're moving to a new house.

The Duke has been less busy than me.  Sadly he didn't make it to the wedding, simply because there was nobody to drive him back home as we headed straight off on honeymoon.  He did make it to <span>Sodbury</span> though.  It was nice to be there in a Land Rover again.  Myself and Dr Johnson headed all the way down to <span>Beaulieu</span> for the day and lugged back a pair of <span>axles</span> for him and a gearbox for myself.
As a result, three things have changed on the blog: 1) soon I'll have a garage with workbench, lights, power and shelving for my ever growing spares collection 2) I'm working on the spare gearbox more than The Duke himself and 3) there's a mucky wedding ring in some of the pictures.

The only real shocker was this.  An eight inch cold chisel which I found in the transfer box oil sump!  Somebody obviously dropped it in there when removing or fitting an overdrive (no OD fitted when I got the gearbox, but I did only pay Â£30 for it).  Not sure it could ever have done any real harm - but it was a brave or foolish man who drove away after dropping this into the gearbox of his Land Rover!
