Stayed in bed 'til 10:30 today because the weather girl told me it'd be raining all day.  As usual, she was completely wrong and I ended up outside all day getting The Duke back up and running.  Here are some pics...

Very productive day, all in all.  I am back on track with the original MOT list of minor jobs.  Still no sign of the Heritage Certificate...
