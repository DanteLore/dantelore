Just about everyone who puts a 200TDi engine into a Series Land Rover will end up looking at the <a href="http://www.glencoyne.co.uk/200di.htm">Glencoyne</a> website at some point.  He's the guy who first suggested taking the turbo off the 200TDi to create a lower powered "200Di" variant.  That's exactly the conversion I am doing so I thought I'd include a plug at the top of this post, especially as I didn't pay him to modify my flywheel housing for me...
