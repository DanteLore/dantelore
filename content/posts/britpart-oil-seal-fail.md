More work on fixing the clutch today, but it all came to nothing.  It was a learning experience and a useful test fitting of the flywheel housing, but otherwise a hugely frustrating day!

Looks much smarter and a much better environment for a clutch to live.

What the pictures don't show is that the plastic fitting "tool" for the seal didn't allow it to properly slip over the crank.  It ended up creased and needed easing with a screwdriver.  Bad news indeed!

Looks very swish now!

Obviously the problem was with the low quality of the rubber in the seal, which seemed very stiff compared to the original.  The stiffness of the rubber and poor quality of the press-out plastic <span>shaper</span> which allows it to slide over the crank (or not!) is hopefully what sets the cheap <span>Britpart</span> replacement apart from the original part.

I'm going to have to order a new original replacement now - for Â£30 - and wait for it to arrive.  Since I'm away on a cake delivery mission next weekend The Duke is going to be off the road for at least another three weeks.  Very depressing!
