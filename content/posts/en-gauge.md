Still waiting for engine parts, so have been working on the electrics again.  Got this snazzy little voltage dropper off eBay this week.  Was about Â£17 including P&P.  It drops a 24-30v supply down to about 12-13v with a peak constant output of 10A.  I think it's designed to power a trucker's radio, but it will also work for my gauges.

I shoved my hand into the tank, wiggled the fuel sender and hey presto!  The gauge rises quite quickly but falls more slowly.  I think it heats a metal strip attached to the needle which expands and contracts.  I doubt much current is drawn at any point, but was pleased to see that it pulls maximum current when the tank is full - and therefore empty of air.  Not much opportunity for a spark or melted wire in the sender, but it's good that if there was, it'd be less likely to blow me to Kingdom Come.

Hopefully even The Duke can't drain a tank of fuel fast enough to beat the gauge!
