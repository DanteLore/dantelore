Still trying to get all the bits together to get The Duke's engine up and running.  The new distributor, leads, coil and plugs arrived this week, so I thought I'd have a look to see if they'd all fit properly.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Problem #1: </span> There is clearly something missing between the distributor and engine.  The Haynes manual mentions some kind of adapter but there are no pictures.
