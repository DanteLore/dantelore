Spent another few hours in the garage with the 200TDi last night.  The main aim was to find out whether the 24v starter motor from the Series III would fit into the flywheel housing of the 200TDi.  The answer was, sadly, no.

To be honest, I'm not worried at all about the flywheel housing modifications.  I have the right tools knocking about and the process is pretty well documented on the internet.  Far more worrying is stuff like the custom exhaust I need to make up (can't afford the manifold swap option as they come in at £100+ these days) and the continuing saga of the 24v/12v electrical system.  More on these issues soon I hope...
