 Just a quick photo of the new door card I made for The Duke. Made of ply wood covered in some vinyl fabric I managed to find at Dunelm Mill with some lift insulation (the sort made out of recycled plastic bottles) in the cavity. Hopefully this will help lower nose levels in the cab and to insulate against the cold. Just got to make one for the other side now!
