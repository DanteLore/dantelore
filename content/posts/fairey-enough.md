Finally found the cash to buy an overdrive!  Got it on eBay for £333.33 - about the going rate.  You'll be interested to know that The Duke himself was £555.55, so this purchase was far from cheap; but it actually comes out somewhere around 5% of the total cost of the restoration, so maybe not so bad.  The 5th gear which the overdrive gives me should also give a pretty good improvement to The Duke's woeful fuel economy and might well pay for itself at some point.  So if you ignore the fact that I could, instead, have spent the money on a five-year-old Mondeo with one careful previous owner, it's money well spent.

﻿So there you have it: a plan and hopefully more stuff to come on the blog.  Watch this space!
