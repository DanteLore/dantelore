The people who share my office were again confused as I opened a parcel as if it contained the Lost Treasure of Atlantis today, only to find me staring in awe at four 70mm M8 bolts with Allen heads.  Bought from an eBay shop called "Bolt Me Up", they were the vital missing component for the reattachment of the suspension.

Lorna was nice enough to cook dinner tonight, so I could spend the entire evening covered in grease and wielding a spanner and socket wrench.  As a result of my hard graft The Duke is back on four wheels!

So, the rear suspension is back on!  Still a little welding to do on an outrigger and some missing bracing on the <span>crossmember</span>.  Plus I need to tie down the brake pipes, finish <span>undersealing</span> the chassis, make a new rear wiring loom (with <span>fuse</span> box), drill drain holes and squirt some <span>waxoyl</span> inside the chassis, test the generator wiring harness and clean and treat the bottom of the tub.  Then I can slap the tub back on!  Woo!
