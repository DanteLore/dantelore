<span style="font-size:100%;">I'd almost given up hope of hearing anything from the RAF museum in response to my history search request, but today I got an email from Peter Elliott, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Senior Keeper</span> in the Department of Research & Information Services. He very kindly attached a scan of The Duke's record card.

</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinetiq">founded in 2001</a>.
</span>
Still no word from <span>QinetiQ</span>, who I contacted a few weeks ago.  Contacted Marshall <span>SV</span> today to see if they have any information.
