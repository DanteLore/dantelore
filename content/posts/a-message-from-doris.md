<span style="font-size:100%;">I'd almost given up hope of hearing anything from the RAF museum in response to my history search request, but today I got an email from Peter Elliott, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Senior Keeper</span> in the Department of Research & Information Services. He very kindly attached a scan of The Duke's record card.

</span><a href="http://www.marshallsv.com/contact.asp"><span>Marshalls</span> <span>SV</span></a> and probably fitted all the helicopter starting equipment.

<span style="font-size:100%;">
</span><a href="http://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/showthread.php?t=6607">Central Vehicle Depot at Hilton</a> near Derby.  Now demolished and replaced with a housing estate.</span>  As far as I can tell, The Duke spent about a week there.

<a href="http://danandtheduke.co.uk/uploaded_images/hilton-735809.jpg"><img src="http://danandtheduke.co.uk/uploaded_images/hilton-735732.jpg"/></a><span style="font-size:85%;">
</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Catterick">RAF <span>Catterick</span></a>, now part of the <span>Catterick</span> Garrison, was transferred from the RAF to the Army in 1994.  Up until that time is was used as a depot by "various squadrons" and the RAF regiment.  This tallies with the record card, which shows that The Duke was stored there (I think) from 1985 to 1994.

<span style="font-size:100%;">There's no mention of RAF <span>Boscombe</span> Down on the card, which shows that The Duke was sold by the RAF from <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo011018/text/11018w13.htm">House of Commons website</a> implies that Aston down was a storage facility, operated by <span>SERCO</span>, who's <span>responsibilities</span> included "</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Support in the disposal of surplus MOD holdings including surplus vehicles"</span>.
<span style="font-size:100%;">
The date of first registration on the log book is 1st April 1997, so I assume the MOD sold him to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Evaluation_and_Research_Agency"><span>DERA</span></a> who later became <span>QinetiQ</span>.</span>  Peter pointed out in his email that vehicles used by research organisations were generally on the civilian register, which seems to match up with the evidence.

<span style="font-size:100%;">It is possible that from 1994 to 1997 The Duke was unregistered on an airfield somewhere.  On 24<span>th</span> March 1997, </span><span style="font-size:100%;">the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/19970401.htm">Road Vehicles Registration and Licensing Regulations</a> were altered with respect to the procedure to be followed on transfer of ownership (log book stuff, basically).  The Duke was registered on a Q plate </span><span style="font-size:100%;">a week later</span><span style="font-size:100%;"> on 1st April that year.

It's still a mystery to me how <span>QinetiQ</span> is registered as the keeper of the vehicle from 1997 when the company was only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinetiq">founded in 2001</a>.
</span>
Still no word from <span>QinetiQ</span>, who I contacted a few weeks ago.  Contacted Marshall <span>SV</span> today to see if they have any information.
