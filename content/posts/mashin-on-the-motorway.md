Bored of my usual commute and keen to make it home as quickly as possible this evening The Duke and I bravely hung a left at Junction 11 and did a single Junction of the M4. Turned out to be fine. We trundled along at 60 in the slow lane, which was stress free but incredibly noisey! I really need to sellotape some camper mats round the gearbox or something!

First time for everything... Couldn't have done it with the old petrol engine!
