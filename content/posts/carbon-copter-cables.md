Spent a couple of hours in the garage soldering the ESCs onto the new Carbon Copter tonight. Four was more than enough. The soldering is without a doubt the most annoying part of multi-rotor construction and I haven't got a clue how people who make Y6 and Octos don't go stark raving bonkers.

The workbench was very busy with wires, all snipped from my last hastily built monstrosity. Shortened the ESC-to-motor cables from 300mm+ to about 100mm. That's bound to save a bit of weight.

Speaking of weight, the whole thing now weighs in at 1.2kg - including the GoPro. That's about a kilo for the airframe, motors, controller, radio, ESCs, cables, props and landing gear. Looks like the electronics tip the scales somewhere around the 200g mark! There are acres of space on the new carbon body too. I hope it flies well because I'm itching to say I love the H-copter design, I just don't want to count my chickens before they fly... or whatever.

All that's left to do now is wire the ESCs to the control board (bit of soldering required because I snipped the plugs off) and flash the KK board with the Quad-X firmware. I might also make up a set of spare legs to take along for the first real test flight.
