During a quiet moment today I made this chart of the costs of the Land Rover project so far.  The various things I've bought are shown by type.  I'm quite pleased that "Tools" is winning, as they'll last me for many years.  "Collection" includes the cost of The Duke and the diesel, trailer rental and whisky bribes needed to get him onto my drive!

Slightly less happy to see "Red Tape" in third place - insurance, MOT, tax and the like are not things I want to spend my hard earned money on!

The chart just shows the figures so far.  There are probably a hundred things I haven't even considered yet!  Land Rover restoration is a costly business.
