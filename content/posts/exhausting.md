I've mentioned before that, long ago, some **** started to undo The Duke's exhaust (probably in a failed attempt to steal the starter) and that fixing it was going to be an absolute nightmare.  Well, this evening I spent three hours doing just that.

I'd meant to start putting the suspension back together, but found I was missing a couple of bits I need.  So given that suspension was suspended, sorting out this nightmare job seemed like a great way to spend a Wednesday evening.  Like I said, it took three hours to do - two of which were spent drilling out one stud!

As a worst case, I'd costed up a new manifold and exhaust for this job (roughly Â£150 worth), so I'm very happy indeed that I got it done for the price of a few drill bits and some elbow grease!
