I've mentioned before that, long ago, some **** started to undo The Duke's exhaust (probably in a failed attempt to steal the starter) and that fixing it was going to be an absolute nightmare.  Well, this evening I spent three hours doing just that.

I'd meant to start putting the suspension back together, but found I was missing a couple of bits I need.  So given that suspension was suspended, sorting out this nightmare job seemed like a great way to spend a Wednesday evening.  Like I said, it took three hours to do - two of which were spent drilling out one stud!

Who knows why somebody put a stud here instead of a bolt.  It's impossible to get a drill anywhere near it, as the carb, manifold and throttle linkage all get in the way.  In the end I got a hole started with a hand drill, then used a really crappy drill extension rod (now in the bin) to drill out the stud.  Very very boring, but I was entertained by some kind of Hari Krisna festival going on down the street!

As a worst case, I'd costed up a new manifold and exhaust for this job (roughly Â£150 worth), so I'm very happy indeed that I got it done for the price of a few drill bits and some elbow grease!
