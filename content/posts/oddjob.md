Had a sneaky couple of hours tonight to do a few odd jobs round The Duke. The good news is that I think I'm ready to put the tub back on! Woo!

Not all good news though.  I've found some more welding to do and some more money to spend - fixing the rusty doors.

So, a little progress today, but a few more jobs discovered too.  The chassis is more or less done and dusted, which is great.  Next job is to concentrate on the body.  Might see if Ron's feeling strong enough to do some tub lifting tomorrow night...
