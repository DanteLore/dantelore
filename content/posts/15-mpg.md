Seems that fixing the clutch has done me some good.  Just did about 66 miles on £22.46 worth of <span>ASDA</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Smart Price</span> petrol.  That equates to 15 MPG.  Quite an improvement on the 10MPG I previously reported, though the soaring price of gas means this improvement only saves me £4 per 100 miles.

Seems I might have been wrong about the 10 MPG too.  Looks like an error in my spreadsheet caused me to calculate it wrongly (bloody software engineers...).  I think the real value should have been more like 12MPG, which is still a pretty low baseline!

Off on an exciting Stag-Weekend adventure tomorrow and taking The Duke along with me.  Will be a good opportunity to gather more data, as well as calculating my own Vodka-MPG.  Expect photos and results in a few days!
